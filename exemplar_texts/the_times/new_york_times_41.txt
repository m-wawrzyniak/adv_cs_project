Bermuda to Allow Autos

Special Cable to THz New York Trves. 

HAMILTON, Bermuda, April 30 
—The Assembly passed today a 
bill empowering the governor in 
council to grant permission under 
| such conditions as he might deem 
| advisable for the use of automo- 
biles in connection with the work 
on the United States defense 
bases. However, a duration clause 
was inserted limiting the pro- 
vision to the end of next year. 

The original text of the bill was 
changed at the suggestion of the 
Speaker of the Assembly, who 
pointed out that the United 
States, by the terms of the leases, 
could operate automobiles in an 
emergency or in case of war. If 
the Americans desired to use 
motor cars in the construction of 
the bases, he said the hil] should 
be drawn specifically to cover 
that. 

During debate it was stated 
that the Americans already were 
using motor trucks and that some 
of Bermuda’s roads were badly 
damaged as a result. It was in- 
timated that the Americans were 
prepared to make good any dam- 
age.

WASHINGTON,

all senior Army Reserve officers

Pew perhaps, holding views 
ved prejudicial] to loyalty was 
ssn at the White House today. 
President Roosevelt’s views on 
| this matter were revealed by &te- 
| phen Early, White House secretary, 
jin connection with making public 
| part of the correspondence cover- 
| ing the President’s refusal to renew 
|the commission of Hugh 8. John- 


most of the $6,333,000,000 which it| Most Unions Call It Communist son, columnist and former Regular 


must borrow in the coming fiscal | 
year. 


Speaking from the White House, | 


the President made what he called 
‘“‘a frank and clear appeal for fi- 
nancial support to pay for our arm- 


ing and to pay for the American | 


existence of later generations."’ 
Secretary Morgenthau emphasized 
that it would be accompanied by 
no “‘drive,’”’ no quotas, no hysteria 
and no appeal to hate or fear. 
Postmaster General Walker, 
speaking from Des Moines, said 
that 16,000 postoffices throughout 
the country would place the new 
bonds and stamps within easy 
reach of Americans no matter 
where they lived. 

The bonds and stamps will go on 


sale tomorrow not only in postof-| 


fices but in banks ard a number of 
other agencies, including many de- 
partment stores. 


Cites Mechanization of War 


The President, whose address was 
recorded on sound tracks by movie 
companies, emphasized that the 
mechanization of war had abolished 
distance and brought danger to the 
very threshold of America. He said 
that he would buy not one but 


twenty stamps to go into books for | 


each of his ten grandchildren. 
He said that the first Defense 


Bavings Bond, of which he would | 


take delivery at the White House 
tomorrow, was being made out in 
the name of Mrs. Roosevelt as 
beneficiary. The reservation of 
these first bond and stamps for the 
President was tangible evidence of 


partnership between the people and | 


their government to perpetuate 
those precious freedoms which gov- 
ernment guarantees, he said. 


A great many Americans, the 


President said, were appreciating | 
their blessings the more when they | 


realized what blessings so many 
other millions had lost this Spring 
and last Spring, people who had 
hoped and prayed and believed that 
fate would let them live on as they 
had always lived. 


Defenses adequate ten years ago | 


were now a broken reed, he said, 
and nations and lands safe ten 
years ago by virtue of distance had 
been overrun by mechanized con- 
querors. 

Asks for Funds for Defense 

Distance was no longer a guaran- 
tee of safety, the President went | 
on. Hence the government was | 
arming and was appealing for fi- 
nancial support to pay for that | 
arming and for the American exist- 
ence of later generations, he said. 

Since jobs were more plentiful 
and wages higher, slight sacrifices 
and the omission of a few luxuries 
would swell the coffers of the Fed- 
eral Treasury, said Mr. Roosevelt. 
But, he asked, would any real sacri- 
fice be involved when more than a 
million of the country’s finest youth 
had been withdrawn from civilian 
life to accept military discipline in 
the defense of their country? 

The defense savings program was 
a privilege and an opportunity to 
share in the defense of all the 
things Americans cherished against 
a threat which must be fought | 
wherever it appeared, and it could 
be found at the very threshold, he 
said. 

Secretary Morgenthau, who also 
spoke at the White House, said that 
Defense Savings bonds and stamps 
were not for the few but for the 
many, for the laboring man, the 


skilled mechanic, the office worker, | 


the housewife, even for children. 
The government was frankly seek- 
ing the regular savings of the peo- | 
ple, he added. It wanted to give | 
them a chance to have a financial | 
stake in America. It wanted tq pre- 


vent a spending spree and resulting | 


-high prices. It wanted every Ameri- 
can family to face the post-war ad- 
justment period with savings pro- | 
tected by the credit of the United 
States of America. 

“There is to be no ‘drive,’” said 
Mr. Morgenthau. ‘‘There are to be 


mo quotas, there is to be no hys- |

| May Day, the annual labor holi-

celebrated here today by a parade 
| condemned in advance, as usual in 
recent years, by many important 
unions and labor leaders who char- 


acterize it as an instrument of the | 


Communist party. 

The United May Day Committee, 
in charge of the parade, accepted 
this characterization yesterday with 
a collective shrug of the shoulders 
and proceeded to list as partici-|

Mr. Early emphasized that this

that no personalities were involved

claimed that ‘‘misleading so-called

In Flight From U. S. 


By The United Press. 

LIMA, Peru, April 30— Baron 
Franz von Werra, the German 
| aviator who escaped from a pris- 
on camp in Canada and later dis- 
appeared from the United States, 
| skipping $15,000 bail, has reached 
| Germany, according to German 
circles here. 

The newspaper La Cronica said 
that von Werra reached Lima 
remained here four days, and 
then went to La Paz, Bolivia. 
According to a German resident, 
von Werra flew from La Paz to 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on a Ger- 
man-controlled airline, and then 
across the Atlantic on a plane of 
the Italian ‘‘Lati’’ Line. 

Von Werra was said to have

NLL FLERS TAKEN 
OFF AMERICAN SHIP 


Canadian Auxiliary Cruiser 
Halts the Garfield Near 
Hawaii and Seizes Four 











By The Associated Press. 

HONOLULU, April 30—American 
President Lines agents report- 
ed today that a Canadian auxiliary 
cruiser, the Prince Robert, had 
jstopped the liner President Gar- 
field and removed four German 
aviators. 

The captain of the Garfield, John 
|E. Murphy, radioed that his craft 
was halted 400 miles off Honolulu 
| yesterday. A crew from the Cana- 
dian ship boarded her, scanned the 





passenger list and took off the Ger- | 


|mans, who had sailed from San 
| Francisco to return to their home- 
|}land by way of Japan and Russia. 
| The Prince Robert, a converted 
|passenger ship, was formerly oper- 
ated on the Canadian run out of 
| Seattle. 
The auxiliary 
|Honolulu Monday, but her presence 
was not disclosed because Secretary 
of the Navy Knox had asked that 
the arrival of British warships in 
American ports not be published. 
When an officer on the Prince 
Robert was asked at that time 
about the possibility of removing 
the Germans from the Garfield he 
said, ‘‘You people must think we 
haven’t much to do.”” His question- 
er was then asked to leave the ship. 
The four German fliers, Ewald 
|Flesch, Werner Naumar, Hans 
Sandkamm and Guenther Katzke, 
formerly employed in the commer- 
cial air service in South America, 
had been detained by the United 
States Immigration Service since 
August. They were released to 
board the President Garfield in San 
Francisco last Friday under au- 
thority of the State Department.

Nazi Drive for All Africa Seen; 


Suez and Dakar Held in Peril 


By BERTRAM D. HULEN 
Special to THE New York Times. 


WASHINGTON, April 30—Ger- 
many is strongly reinforcing her 
forces in North Africa, according to 





anti-communist | 
| ment 
| struggling against communist dom- | 
ination have voted to pay no fur-| 
thes attention to May Day and not | 


reports received here. The move- 
is of sufficient strength to 
lead to conjectures in official cir- 
cles as to whether the next Nazi 
movement may be concurrent 


| drives toward Suez and westward 
|toward the Atlantic. In that event 
labor day and has| 


the status of General Maxime Wey- 
gand’s French force in North 
Africa might be involved. 

The drive on Suez, it is felt, may 
be in the familiar pincers pattern 
of a forward thrust from the pres- 
ent Nazi position on the Egyptian 
border and on the other side along 
the coasts of Syria and Palestine. 

Reports show that the German 
forces are moving from island to 
island in the Aegean and it is 
feared that Crete may before long 
come under Axis control, strategi- 
cally if not actually. In addition, it 
is said that the Nazi victory in 
Yugoslavia and Greece has had 
seriously deteriorating effects in 


the entire Mediterranean area, with 
Turkey showing every disposition 
to play safe. 

German reinforcements in North 
Africa are going forward by plane 
and water transport, according to 
advices received here. Although no 
figures are revealed, the movement 
apparently is so large as to more 
than meet the requirements of a 
Nazi drive to the East for Suez, 
arousing conjectures concerning & 
westward push. 

The situation offers a possible ex- 
Planation of recent Nazi pressure 
on Vichy, particularly if the status 
of General Weygand’s army should 
be involved. Moreover, a success- 
ful drive to the Atlantic, it is esti- 
mated, would not only bring Nazi 
troops across from Gibraltar but 
might be timed to coincide with a 
German march through Spain and 
Portugal to attack Gibraltar from 
that side.

‘Senate Committee Hears From | 


Hull and Smothers Two 
Anti-Convoy Resolutions 


By TURNER CATLEDGE 
Special to THE New YorxK Trues. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—While 
his leaders in Congress were beat- 
ing down all efforts to restrict by 
law the use of American naval ves- 
sels for convoy purposes, President 
Roosevelt ordered the acquisition 
by the Maritime Commission of 
2,000,000 tons of existing merchant 
shipping, domestic and foreign, for 
operation ‘‘in such a manner as will 
make their cargo space immediately 
effective in accomplishing our ob- 
jective of all-out aid to the democ- 
racies,”’ 

The action at the Capitol was an 
unmistakable show of determina- 
tion by the President's followers in 
Congress to give him the freest pos- 
sible hand in dealing with the in- 
creasingly acute shipping problem. 

They not only rallied to reject, by 
a vote of 13 to 9, in the Senate For- 
eign Relations Committee, the Nye 
and Tobey resolutions which would 
have prevented or hampered his 
ordering of the Navy to convoy 
duty, but they refused even to allow 
the resolutions to be reported ‘‘un- 
favorably,’’ thereby spiking, for the 
time being, the purpose of the Pres- 
ident’s critics to force the convoy 
issue to the Senate floor for a full- 
dress debate. 


Toward the ‘Bridge of Ships’ 


Washington interpreted the Pres!- 
dent’s move on shipping as a step 
toward the practical realization of 
the ‘‘bridge of ships’’ which he 
promised would be built to facili- 
tate American aid to the beleaguered 
democracies. 

His instructions were sent in a 
letter to Rear Admiral Emory §. 
Land, chairman of the Maritime 
Commission, soon after he had con- 
ferred at the White House with this 
| Official and Harry L. Hopkins, 








aid program. 

He told Admiral Land that the 
plan naturally fell into two parts: 
First, the utilization, in routes to 
the combat zone, of foreign ships 
or ships to be transferred to for- 
eign registry, and the reallocation 
of American flag ships, including 
those to be completed in the next 
few months, ‘‘in such a way as to 
make every cargo directly or in- | 
directly useful to our defense ef- | 
forts and the winning by the de- 
mocracies of the battle now being 
waged in the Atlantic.’’ 

The President said he realized 
that great inconvenience and loss 
of trade would likely result from 
such a diversion of American ships, 
but he held that we must supply 
whatever cargo space we can to the 
cause of a victory for democracy. 
He felt sure that owners and the 
public would ‘“‘gladly cooperate in 
i this essential enterprise.’ 


Sources of Ships Outlined 


|The President did not indicate in 
his communication the source from 
which he expected the ships to be 
|taken. But Admiral Land said ina 
speech before the Chamber of Com- 
merce of the United States in the 
afternoon that they would be ac- 
quired by withdrawing vessels from 
inter-coastal trade, the Army and 
| Navy auxiliaries, 
of the 








loperated by American flag ships; 
‘and by requisitioning foreign ves- 


| sels now in American ports, 


seeking by every means to speed 
through Congress. 

Officials estimated that foreign 
ships which might be taken over 
under the requisitioning authority 
are now approaching a total of 
nearly 1,000,000 tons. This amount 
is said to be in the waters of the 
United States alone, and does not 
take into account a million tons or 
more in other Western Hemisphere 
harbors and which may be taken 
over by the other countries and 
joined in a shipping ‘‘pool’’ which 
the President and his advisers have 
under consideration, 

The President did not specify in 
his letter to Admiral Land how 
much of the required 2,000,000 tons 
would be transferred to the British. 
It was learned from other officials, 
however, that the disposition of this 
government is to keep as full con- 
trol as possible over all of this par- 
ticular emergency shipping. 

The United States is said to be 
facing a shipping shortage of its 
own, with strategic war materials 
piling up at many ports over the 
world, and no facilities available 
for bringing them to factories here. 

Some part of the total will be con- 
tributed by seventy-one new ships 
to be delivered by American yards

THURSDAY, 

Some 48,000 British troops out 
of 60,000 originally landed in 
Greece have been safely evacu- 
ated, the British announced of- 
ficially early this morning. Yes- 
terday Prime Minister Churchill 
had told a cheeringg House of 
Commons that “at least’ 45,000 
had been brought out. British 
dead and wounded totaled 3,000, 
he said, and considerable heavy 
equipment had been abandoned, 
but the entire evacuation had 
been undertaken on the express 
advice and suggestion of the 
Greek Government when further 
resistance was deemed useless. 
[Page 1, Column 8.] 

The German High Command 
said that 5,000 British troops, in- 
cluding one general, had been 
taken in the Greek campaign. 
[Page 2, Column 2.] 

A sidelight of the war was re- 
vealed in the presence of the 
British Minister to Yugoslavia 
and his staff in Italian-occupied 





supervisor of the lease-lend allied- | 


the laid-up fleets | 
United States and from| 
than | men but were going into the Naziiroutes to foreign ports now being 


the | 
authority for which is contained in| 
a bill which the Administration is | 


Durazzo, Albania, whence he will 
leave for London via Rome and 
Lisbon. Following the invasion 
of Yugoslavia by Axis forces, a 
British submarine flying a white 
flag surfaced amid Italian war- 
ships at the Yugoslav port of 
Cattaro, took aboard an Italian 
officer as hostage and sent one 
of its own crew to find the Brit- 
ish mission. An attack by Ital- 
jan planes, however, forced the 
submarine to dive and flee, leav- 
ing behind the Minister and his 
aides but carrying away the 
Italian officer hostage. [Page 1, 
Column 7.] 


Officials in Washington ex- 
amined with concern reports in- 
dicating that large numbers of 
German troops were being trans- 
ported to North Africa and it 
was believed that not only would 
the Axis drive east toward Suez 
continue but also a drive west, 
across French Morocco to Span- 
ish Morocco opposite Gibraltar, 
might be timed to coincide with 
a direct attack on Gibraltar 
through Spain. [Page 1, Col- 
umn 3.] 





The International Situation 


MAY 1, 1941 

The controlled Russian press 
reported that 12,000 German 
troops, with tanks and artillery, 
had landed at the port of Abo, 
in Southern Finland, approxi- 
mately fifty miles from the Rus- 
sian military base of Hangoe. In 
Washington the Finnish Minis- 
ter denied the truth of the 
report and said fewer than 1,300 
unarmed German soldiers had de- 
barked at Abo en route to Nor- 
way in accordance with a Ger- 
man-Finnish troop transfer ac- 
cord. [Page 1, Column 6; Map. 
Page 6.] 

Diplomatic circles in Berne 
heard that Russia was sending 
heavy troop reinforcements to 
Estonia, to the Ukraine and to 
Soviet-occupied Poland. [Page 6, 
Column 1.] 

Germany and Britain contin- 
ued to exchange heavy air blows. 
While Nazi bombers were strik- 
ing at Plymouth for the fifth 
time in eight nights, the R. A. F. 
attacked Mannheim with new 
heavy bombs, and London re- 
ported that American Douglas 
bombers had been used in harry- 
ing Nazi airports in Northern 
France and shipping along the 
coast. [Page 8, Column 3.] 

The increasing use of Ameri- 
can aircraft by the Royal Air 
Force was also indicated by 
Colonel John Jouett, president of 
the American Aeronautical 
Chamber of Congress, who de- 
clared that “even now half our 
output, coupled with British out- 
put, exceeds Axis plane produc- 
tion, according to the best ob- 
tainable estimates.” [Page 15, 
Column 1.] 

Moving to speed American 
shipping aid to Britain as well, 
President Roosevelt called on the 
Maritime Commission to prepare

‘Reports an Armored Division 
Has Landed at Abo—Only 
1,300, Helsinki Asserts 


By The Associated Press. 
MOSCOW, April 30—Soviet Rus- 
sia reported today that Germany 
| had landed 12,000 troops with tanks 





land, within fifty miles of the 
Hangoe military base that the 
U.S.S.R. won in her conqueror’s 
peace with the Finnish Republic. 

An sccount of the movement of 
these forces—of a size about that of 
an armored division—was given on 
the eve of another Soviet May Day, 
while the Red Army was prepar- 
ing demonstrations of its might 
throughout the Soviet Unioa. 

Pravda, the official organ or the 
Communist party, published the re- 
port without comment in a nine- 
line dispatch from its special cor- 
respondent in Tallinn, Estonia, now 
a part of the U.S.S.R. 

German sources in Moscow imme- 
diately minimized the movement 
and said it was only a part of the 
regular transit of troops from Ger- 
many through Finland to Norway 
that nas been going on for weeks, 
more or less openly. 

{In Helsinki and New York of- 
ficial Finnish statements denied 
the Pravda report, and said that 
fewer than 1,300 German soldiers

port of Abo under the terms of

ATHENS BACKED RETREAT, 


Eden Reveals Message From 
Greeks Advising That Course 
When Their Army Collapsed 


By The United Press 

CAIRO, Egypt, Thursday, May 1 
| —British Middle East headquarters 
| announced last night that 8) per 
| cent of the original British Expedi- 
| tionary Force in Greece had been 
| safely withdrawn. [As the original 
| force was 60,000 men this appar- 
|}ently means that 48,000 got out.) 

The men succeeded in retaining 
their personal fighting equipment, 
it was said. Heavy equipment 

| and transport facilities were lost, 
|however, but headquarters said 
| they would soon be replaced. 

The communiqué said that intense 
| bombing by German planes made 
| Piraeus, the port of Athens, impos- 
| sible for use in the evacuation. 
| Consequently, the embarkation was 
| carried out from open beaches, de- 
| spite continuous German pressure 
|on land and repeated attacks from 
the air. 

“Under such circumstances the 
withdrawal of large numbers of 
| troops can be effected only at the 
cost of heavy losses in vehicles and 
}equipment,’’ said the communiqué, 
“while the rear guard forces 
which cover the withdrawal may 
have to sacrifice themselves to se- 
cure the re-embarkation of others.” 

All Forces Win High Praise 

‘During the last week re-embar- 
kation of the personnel of the em- 
| pire forces in Greece has been tak- 
|ing place under most difficult con- 
ditions. 

‘Full results cannot yet be given, 
| but at least 80 per cent of the orig- 
inal force are already safely con- 
veyed to areas where they ean un- 
dertake further active employ- 
ment.”’ 

The headquarters praised the 
“great skill and devotion” of all 
| three arms of the service—air, land 
| and sea—for making the highly suc- 
cessful withdrawal possible. 

“The rear guards who covered the 
withdrawal imposed on the enemy a 
slow, cautious advance, in spite of 
the great superiority of numbers,” 
the communiqué said. 

| Similar praise was given the 
Royal Air Force for providing 
| ‘some measure of protection to 
| ships during passage,’’ although it 
| was heavily outnumbered, as well 





| from Greece with transport planes. 
The Royal Navy and merchant 
service also drew strong commen- 
dation. 

“It is noteworthy that, in spite of 
the heavy fighting they have been 
through and the trying. experience 
of re-embarkation under such con- 
ditions, the troops which returned 
from Greece are entirely unper- 
turbed by the struggle against such 
|}odds and are convinced of their 
| Superiority over the Germans both 
|a& individuals and as units,” the 
communiqué said.

safety. 


For nine hours the Regent floated |

indications of the Minister’s where-

Campbell aboard and convey him 
to safety.

tenant and a petty officer were |

Thereupon the Regent’s comman- 
der decided he could not afford to 


risk further attacks by waiting | 


longer and he closed the hatch, im- 


prisoning the Italian hostage, sub- | 
merged and escaped from the har- | 


bor. The mate was left behind. To 


|} get away it was necessary to thread 
perilously through the two mine} 


fields that the Regent had braved 
to enter. 

The fact that the British craft 
lay nine hours in the Italian-held 
harbor is regarded here as a tribute 
to the coolness and determination 
of her officers and crew.

Churchill Reports 


By CRAIG THOMPSON 
Special Cable to THE New Yore Trugs. 
LONDON, April 30;-Prime Min- 

ister Winston Churchill reported to 
the House of Commons today that 
at least 45,000 men of the British 
Expeditionary Force had been suc- 
cessfully evacuated from Greece. 
He said they had suffered 3,000 
casualties. The fate of the rest of 
the 60,000 men sent to Greece was 
left to conjecture. 

| (Berlin reported the capture of 

5,000 British Imperial troops, in- 
cluding a general, tn mopping-up 
operations. ] 

At the same time Foreign Secre- 
tary Anthony Eden reported to the 
House that the withdrawal from 
Greece had been thoroughly con- 
curred in by the Greek Govern- 
|ment, which he said approved be- 
cause it was unable any longer to 
support itself in the military sense. 

These first official reports of. re- 
;sults of the Greek campaign had 
the effect of giving the British peo- 
ple their own version of what was 
going on as compared with ‘‘ex- 
travant claims made by the enemy,” 
as Mr. Churchill put it. Now for 
the first time from their own 
sources they are learning the facts 
‘of the Greek campaign.

‘Expect Full Occupation of the) 
Country Shortly—Begin to 
Organize Administration 


By C. BROOKS PETERS 

By Telephone to THE New Yorx TIMES. 

BERLIN, April 30—The Greek | 
lcampaign is now “concluded,” it | 
| was stated in authoritative military 
quarters here this evening. It is be- | 
lieved the occupation of all strate- | 
|gically vital positions on the Pelo- | 
| ponnesus by the German armed 
| forces must be but a matter of very 
| short time, if it has not already 


| been accomplished. 
| According to today’s High Com- 
|mand communiqué, motorized units 
lof the German Army pushed on to 
|the southern ports of Peloponnesus | 


|and prevented further evacuation of 





the British Imperial forces by sea. | 


| Up to the time the communiqué was 

issued, it 
| troops, including one general, 
| well as numerous Serbs, including 
| four generals and 300 other officers, 
| had been taken prisoners 


| 
| Only One Phase of Bigger Plan 


| this evening it was emphasized that 
|the Greek campaign was only one 
|phase of the larger undertaking to 
eject the British from the Mediter- 
|ranean, particularly 
Mediterranean. With the capture of 
|the Greek bases, German military 
quarters eiterated that Britain’s 
positions in this latter sector, par- 
ticularly in Egypt, were directly 
threatened. 





the Reich’s armed forces have gath- 
ered in the Sudetenland, the Neth- | 
erlands, Belgium, Norway and 
France, particularly in Paris, it| 
was stated here today, five prin- 
ciples for the military administra- | 
tion of occupied territories have 
been evolved. 

The first step is a survey of sup- 
plies and facilities in the territory | 
to be administered. Military admin- 
istrators for the distribution of the 
available supplies and for the main- | 
tenance or repair of economically 
vital installations have been ap- 
pointed. 

The German military regime, it 
is added, seeks as local administra- | 
tors inhabitants of the territory | 
who represent the interests of their | 
people and can function smoothly | 
with the occupation authorities. | 
Where, as in Serbia, no functioning | 
government exists, the posts right | 
up to the top are entrusted to suit- | 
able Serbs, if such can be found. | 
In Athens the formation of a new} 
government [under General Tsola-| 
koglu, who signed the Greek ca- 
pitulation] is said to make the sit- | 
uation simpler. The Greek police 
are to be augmented by adding de-| 
mobilized soldiers to their ranks. | 


Services Being Restored 


First-aid measures are then im- 
mediately begun. The most urgent | 
of these are to restore electrical | 
service and, as in the case of Bel- 
grade, provide water for the pop- 
ulation. War prisoners will be em- 
ployed in repairing damage to 
streets and demolishing or rein- 





| 





forcing damaged houses. 
By distribution of rationing cards| 
or by control of the sale of food-| 


| stuffs, the military administration 


plans to take a census of the popu- 
lation. This is deemed necessary 


| because during wartime many per- 


sons leave or change their places of 
residence. 

Finally, informed quarters 
clare, the problem of transport, es- 
pecially of vital materials and food- | 
stuffs, is to be solved. 

As a result of the application of | 
this proven system, it is stated, | 


de- | 





| section of the Turkish press are in- 


|cles in Berlin as presaging an early 








normal life already has been re- 
stored in Belgrade and Salonika. 

The formation of a new govern- 
ment in Athens provokes sympa- 
thetic comment in official quarters 
here, but there is as yet no tendency 
to reach conclusions as to General 
Tsolakoglou’s prospects of ulti- 
mate success, although his initial 
pronouncement suggested oppor- 
tunities for German cooperation, it 
was stated. 

As the former government had 
decamped, the appearance of a suc- 
cessor is accepted here as signal- 
izing the end of the war in Greece | 
and as an indication that Greece is 
determined to become a factor for 
order in the Balkans. There are 
indications that the German occu- 
pation authorities are prepared to 
promote conciliatory relations and 
that such a political reorientation 
on the part of the new Athens lead- 
ers cannot fail to have a favorable 
reaction in Turkey also.

Ankara government in the direc- 
tion of Turkey's pro-Axis orienta- 
tion.

BERLIN, April 30 (UP)—It is an- 
nounced that German planes at- 
tacked and heavily damaged three 
British vessels totaling about 27,000 | 
tons, including a 13,000-ton tanker, 
in Suda Bay, off Crete. 

A British Walrus flying boat was 
reported shot down near the Island 
of Hydra in the operations in| 
Greece and four British seaplanes 
destroyed on the southeast coast of 
the Peleponnesus. 

The German military commander 
of Yugoslavia, General Foerster, 
has formed an administrative coun- 
cil to facilitate reconstruction in the 
occupied territory, the official news 
agency, D. N. B., reported from 
Belgrade tonight. 

A number of Serbians were report- 
ed named commissars to head for- 
mer administrations.

closest cooperation with the mili-|

tives, so that calm and order pro- 
duced by the German Wehrmacht 
continues and at the same time the 
national economy is utilized fully,” 
said the agency.

THE NEW YORK ‘TIMES, 


British 
CAIRO, Thursday May 1 \® 
A communiqué issued early today 
by the British Middle East com- 
mand follows: 


When it became obvious that 
the resistance of the Greek Army 
to German invasion was at an 
end, the Government of Greece 
requested that the empire con- 
tingent which had been sent to 
its help should be withdrawn 
from Greece. 

At this time empire troops 
were in close contact with the 
enemy on the Thermopylae posi- 
tion after their withdrawal from 
more forward positions. The en- 
emy by employment of greatly 
superior numbers had obtained 
complete command of land and 
air and by repeated attacks had 
made unusable the one available 
good port, Piraeus, at Athens. 
Consequently, re-embarkation had 
to take place from open beaches 
against continual enemy pressure 
on land and heavy repeated at- 
tacks from the air. 

In such circumstances the with- 
drawal of large numbers of troops 
could only be effected at a cost of 
heavy losses in vehicles and equip- 


| ment, while the rear guards which 


cover its withdrawal may have to 
sacrifice themselves to secure re- 
embarkation of the others. 

During the last week the re- 
embarkation of personnel of the 
empire forces in Greece has been 
taking place in most difficult con- 
ditions. Full results cannot yet be 
given 

At least 80 per cent of the origi- 
nal force already has been safely 
conveyed to areas where it can 
undertake further active employ- 
ment. 

This 
possible as 
skill and devotion by all 
arms of the services. 

The Roya] Navy and merchant 
service have shown great courage 
and devotion in the face of heavy 
and sustained air attacks against 
ports and beaches where embar- 
kation has taken place. 

The Royal Air Force and the 
fleet air arm, although very 
heavily outnumbered, have played 
their part both in providing some 
measure of protection of ships 
during their passage and in con- 
veying key personnel from 
Greece with transport and air-

It is noteworthy that in spite 
of the heavy fighting they have 
been through and the trying ex- 
perience of re-embarkation under 
such conditions, troops which re- 
turned from Greece are entirely 
unperturbed by their struggle 
against such odds and are con- 
vinced of their superiority over 
the Germans both as individuals 
and as units and formations. 

The successful withdrawal of so 
large a proportion of these inval- 
uable troops is a noteworthy 
achievement.

CAIRO, Egypt, April 30 (P— 
British Middle East Headquarters 
issued this communiqué today: 


Greece—The withdrawal of our 
troops is continuing satisfactorily. 

Ethiopia—Units of the Sudan de- 
fense force captured Socota on 
Sunday last, inflicting many casu- 
alties on the enemy. A further 
515 prisoners have been taken, 
of whom 400 colonial troops im- 
mediately volunteered to enter 
the Emperor’s service. 

In all other areas the activities 
of our own troops and patriot 
forces continue steadily to clear 
the country of isolated detach- 
ments. 

The Royal Air Force Middle East 
communiqué, issued in Cairo, said: 


Libya—Concentrations of enemy 
aircraft at the Benina and Derna 


airdromes were heavily raided by 
aircraft of the R. A. F. during 
the night of April 28-29. Many 
bombs burst among dispersed 
enemy aircraft. Bengazi harbor 
also was raided, many explosions 
occurring as a result of the bomb- 
ing. 

Our fighters continued to harass 
the enemy by low-level machine- 
gun attacks. Three enemy aircraft 
have been shot down by anti-air- 
craft gunfire over Tobruk during 
the past two days. 

Ethiopia—Enemy troop positions 
and ammunition dumps were at- 
tacked in the Wadera area by air- 
craft of the South African Air 
Force. Motor transport was de- 
stroyed and heavy casualties 
caused among white and native 
troops. Direct hits were regis- 
tered on buildings at Tandeho 
aerodrome. Buildings at Sifani 
also were hit. 

Mediterranean—Constant convoy 
patrols were flown by R. A. F. 

aircraft over certain areas of the 
Mediterranean, in the course of 
which enemy aircraft attacks 
were repeatedly repulsed. 

From all of these operations, 
four of our aircraft are missing. 





| LONDON, April 30 (®)—The Air 
| Ministry issued this communiqué 
| today: 

Last night aircraft of the 
bomber command made an attack 
in force on Mannheim, the princi- 
pal industrial and commercial 
city of Softthwest Germany. 
Thousands of incendiaries and a 
large number of high explosive 
bombs, among them some of the 
latest and most powerful type, 
were dropped. Large fires were 
started both in the town and 
among the docks. 

Other aircraft successfully at- 
tacked the extensive oil stores at 
Rotterdam. 

One of our bombers is missing 
from these night operations. 

In daylight yesterday aircraft 
of the same command, some of 
which were escorted by fighters, 
attacked ships from a very low 
level off the coasts of France, 
Belgium and Norwuy. One supply 
ship of about 5,000 tons was set 
on fire and four others of be- 
tween 1,000 and 2,000 tons were 
hit and damaged. 

From these daylight operations 
two of our bombers and one of 
our fighters are missing. 

Early today the Air Ministry 
and Ministry of Home Security 
said: 

Last night a town in Southwest 
England was severely raided by 
enemy aircraft, and a number of 
fires were started It is feared 
that casualties will prove heavy 
and that a large number of per- 
sons have lost their lives. 

Bombs were also dropped at 
other points ir the Southwest and 
in Southern England, East Anglia 
and South Wales. Some damage 
was done, and at one place in 
South Wales there was a num- 
ber of casualties and some per- 
sons were killed. 

Three enemy bombers were de- 
stroyed by our fighters during the 

Following is the night communi- 
qué of the Air and Home Security 
| Ministries: 

During the day a small number 
of enemy aircraft, flying singly, 
crossed our coasts at widely sep- 
arated points but nowhere have 
they flown far inland. No bombs 
have been dropped. 

It is now confirmed that five 
enemy bombers were shot down 
by anti-aircraft gunfire last night. 
These with three which were de- 
stroyed by fighters make a total 
of eight enemy aircraft destroyed 
during the night.

By Telephone to Tos NEW Yoru Timaus. 

MADRID, Spain, April 30—The 
press, which yesterday embarked 
upon another meaningful cam- 
paign, suddenly abstained from all 
political comment today. The peo- 
ple of Madrid were left free to con- 
centrate their attention upon new | 
regulations drastically curtailing 
the amount of food that can be 
served in restaurants. 

Ever since the end of the war, 
even during the worst days of the 
near-famine here last Winter, it 


lent meal in a restaurant, with no 
restrictions upon the number of 
dishes and without any attempt to 
compel clients to forego part of 
their normal food ration. However, 
as the average meal in a respectable 
Madrid restaurant comes to $4 or 
$5, this means that evading the 
ration system has been beyond the 
reach of all except the wealthy. 
Under the regulations announced 
today restaurants can serve meat

|Cuban Inquiry Clears Florida 
Resident, Held by Navy 


Wireless to Tos Naw Yorx Times, 

HAVANA, April 30—Cuban avu- 
thorities this afternoon released 
Frederick Wagner, an American 
resident of Florida, who with a 
nurse and a crew of two lodged at 
the Tiscornia immigration station 
on Monday when the Navy took into 
custody Mr. Wagner's yacht, the 
Ezgoing, near Batabano, on the 
south coast of Cuba. 

Investigation proved according to 
the immigration officials’ announce- 
ment that Mr. Wagner is an Ameri- 
can citizen and that his papers were 
in order, although, it was at first 
reported that he lacked customs 
documents to permit the yacht to 
enter Cuban ports. 

The crewmen, William Wood and 
Hadon Yates, are British subjects 
and are said to be residents of the 
Isle of Pines. The nurse, G. Fraser, 
is an American. 





only when meat is being distributed 
in that neighborhood to everybody. 
They can give their clients only the 
amount of bread to which they are 


| entitled on a household ration card. 


This bread ration is now back to 
three ounces a day for the well-to- 


half that. As for meat, for nine 
consecutive weeks last Winter not 
an ounce of meat was distributed 


considerable quantities arrived by 


per person—once a 
month. 

The restaurants were also forbid- | 
den today to serve more than two | 
courses, not counting dessert and 
hors d'oeuvres or soup. Ration card | 
tickets still will not be collected, | 
but the new move undoubtedly will 
greatly reduce the incentive to dine 


out.

From Syria the Nazi mechanized

4,000 AT PAPAL AUDIENCE 


Number at Wednesday Cere-

The return of German Ambassa- | 


dor Franz von Papen from Berlin | 


was anxiously awaited, as it was 
| generally believed he would bring 
| proposals or demands upon Turkey, 
| He was reported to be still in Ber- 
lin in conference with his leaders. 

There was no official confirmation 
of rumors that President Ismet 
Inonu, now absent from Ankara, 
might be proceeding to a conference 
with Adolf Hitler in Germany. 
Neither the newspapers nor the 
radio mentioned his absence. 

The newspaper Vakit noted with 

alarm the German occupation of 
|Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, 
declaring that ‘‘if the British Navy 
| does not interfere even Crete will 
| be taken.”’ 
“For Turkey, the invasion of 
| these islands is of life and death 
importance, because it is not im- 
possible that the forces that gather 
|there might attack Turkey,’’ the 
paper added. ‘‘That should not be 
} possible while the British Navy is in 
the Mediterranean, but the Turkish 
people must remember all possibili- 
ties and recall what happened to 
| Norway.” 





complained an editorial in Yeni 
| Sabah, ‘‘are why the British do 
not bomb Rumanian oil fields, why 
repeated attacks on the German 
|cruisers Gneisefiau. and Scharn-

IN NORTH AFRICA 


| Dulles Urges Sending of Troops 


to Set Up Supply Center 


In an address on the present site 
uation abroad Allen W. Dulles, at- 
torney and authority on foreign af- 
fairs, last night suggested to the 
Young Women’s Republican Club 
that it might be advisable for the 
States to move into North 
with troops and machines 
and to establish there a base from 
which to send future supplies to 
England. If North Africa falls, he 
argued, the lattle is half lost, for 
the British blockade will be cut and 
England’s chances of survival dras- 
tically reduced 

Already it may be too late to 
achieve any kind of action by the 
American Government which might 
thwart the German advance, he 
conceded, for public opinion in this 
country, he is confident, is not pre- 
pared to make such concessions. 
Our margin of time to make up our 
minds that ‘no such half-way 
measures as the lend-lease bill’’ will 
be effective, he declared, may be 
only a matter of a few weeks. 

“The thing is simply too big to 
be met by half-way efforts,’’ he as- 
serted. ‘‘We are faced today with 
the alternative of going to war 
or seeing a defeated England. We 
may yet be too late.’”’

sent to England, Mr. Dulles said,

Commentry. 

This leaves the 
garding impending 
more indefinite than ever, but offi- 
cial circles gave denial today to 
reports that have found an echo 


speculation re- 
negotiations | 


in the Swiss press with regard to a | 


reported intervention by 
William D. Leahy, American Am- 
bassador, during his conference 
with Marshal Pétain last Friday. 
It was hinted in the Swiss news- 
papers that the American Ambassa- 
dor had suggested that closer rela- 
tions between France and the 
Reich might risk interrupting the 
sending of foodstuffs to unoccupied 
France from America, and there 
Was even an implication that the 
Ambassador had urged that France 
should make no opposition if there 
should be British initiatives in 
North Africa. 

These implications, it was stated 
by the French sources here today, 
are absolutely without foundation. 
Nothing official has been issued re- 
garding the American Ambassa- 
dor’s talk with Marshal Pétain, and 
the versions printed abroad were 
qualified as surmises Admiral 
Leahy himself would make no dec- 
laration, except to say that his talk 
with Marshal Petain had been gen- 
eral in characte 

The press in Paris, which has 
been to some e> t reflected in re- 
cent articles here, remarks upon 
the fact that no shipments of food 
from America other than Red Cross 
shipments have been received in 
France to date, and points out that 
what is due on the two ships now en 
route will last the free about 
one week These observations, on 
the eve of the arrival of the first 
American food ships, zive some 
idea of the trend developing in the 
directed press, but it is fair to state 
that, in the centers where the goods 
recently brought by Red Cross ships 
from America are still being distrib- 
uted daily, there is a very sincere 
feeling of gratitude unhesitatingly

right now I shall give the figures

the evacuati of 
from Greece. 

“Up to the time when evacuation 
was seen to be inevitable, we had 
landed about 60,000 men in Greece, 
including one Australian and one 
New Zealand division. Of these 
about 45,000 have been evacuated. 

‘“‘Considering that our air force| 
was, through the superiority of the| 
enemy, forced to leave the air 


fields from which it could operate 
effectively in covering the retreat 
of our troops and only a small por- 
tion could be used to cover points 
of embarkation, this must be con- 
sidered remarkable. 

“The conduct of our troops, es- 
pecially the rear guard, in fighting 


yn empire 


itheir way so many miles to the sea 


merits the highest praise. 

‘This is the first instance where 
air bombing, prolonged day after 
day, has failed td break the discip- 
line and order of marching col-| 
umns who, besides being thus as-| 
sailed from the air, were pursued 
by no less than three armored divi- 
sions as well as the whole strength 
of the German mechanized army | 
that could be brought to bear. 

Estimates Losses as 3,000

tympus and around 
hermopylae, about 
killed and wound- 
ed to have been suf- 
fered by our 3. This is a very 
small part of the losses inflicted on 
the Germans, who on several occa- 
sions, sometimes for two days at a 
were brought to a standstill | 
by one-fifth their number. Nor does | 
it take account of the losses the 
incurred in their oni 
slaughts on the Greek and Yugo-| 


slav Armies. 

‘It will, I dare say, be possible to 
give a fuller account in the debate 
next week, but I think I have said 
enough to show that, painful as our 
losses may be, we have much for 
which to be thankful and our em- 
pire forces have much of which to 
be proud,” 

The persistence of the Members 
seeking to find out what Mr. Eden 
had learned on his visit to the Mid- 
dle East brought from him the com-| 
ment that ‘‘the Greek Premier on | 
April 21 had sent the British Gov- 
ernment the following note | 

‘The Greek Government, while 
expressing to the British Govern- 
ment and to the gallant imperial 
troops their gratitude for the aid 
which they have extended to Greece 
in her defense against the unjust 
aggressor, are obliged to make the 
following statements: 

“After having conducted 
more than six monhts a victorious 
struggle against strongly superior 
forces, the Greek Army has now 
reached a state of exhaustion and, 
moreover, finds itself completely 
deprived of certain resources indis- 
pensable for the pursuit of the war 
such as munitions, motorized vehi- 
cles and airplanes—resources 
which it in any case inade- 
quately supplied from the outbreak 
of the war 

“This state of things makes it 
impossible the Greeks to con- 
tinue the struggle with any chance 
of success and deprives them of all 
hope of being able to lend some 
assistance to their valiant allies. At 
the same time, in view

for 


in view of the limited 
at their disposal and in 
the extent of the front 
heroically defended by them, the 
Imperial forces have an absolute 
need of the assistance of the Greek 
Army, without which they could not 
their own resistance for 
more than a few days. 

“In these conditions the continua- 
tion of the struggle, while incapa- 
ble of producing any useful effect, 
would have no other result than 
to bring about the collapse of the 
Greek Army and bloodshed useless 
to the Allied forces. Consequently 
the Royal Government is obliged to 
state that further sacrifice of the 
British Expeditionary Force would 
be in vain and that its withdrawal

MORAL VICTORY IN GREECE 


By HANSON W. BALDWIN 


Prime Minister Winston Churchill | 
announced yesterday a moral vic-| 
tory in the British evacuation of | 
Greece as Finland—which fought} 
the good fight last year only to! 
succumb to the mass strength of | 
aggression—again came into the 
news, 

Greece and Finland, poles apart 
except in the sturdy courage of 
their separate struggles for their | 
ways of life, seem on the surface | 
to have no common denominator in | 


the bitter European struggle. But | 
such is the strategic, economic and | 


| political situation in Europe today 


that the slightest stone cast into 
continental waters will cause a/| 
wave or a ripple that may have| 
profound consequences on distant 
shores, 

The German victory in Greece, a 
considerable materisni one, already 
is having that effect, upon Turkey, 
upon Russia, and across the seas. 


But the effects of that victory may 


have been somewhat dampened | 
by the announcement that 80 per | 
cent of the British Expedition- | 
ary Force had been successfully 
evacuated from Greece. And the 
clear implication that evacuation 
was continuing gave a more op- 


timistic picture for the British of 
the Greek operations than many 





|Britons themselves had dared hope | 


for. 

A 48,000 had 
safely extracted from their perilous 
situation in Greece, 3,000 were 


total of men been 


| wounded or dead, and the remainder | 


of the 60,000 originally landed there 


were apparently unaccounted for. 
Some of the last group may still 
escape; others undoubtedly have} 
been captured. The Germans 
claimed yesterday the capture of 
5,000 British, and had previously 


claimed the capture of hundreds of 
others. 


Equipment Loss Great 


The final toll is not yet known; 
if it amounts to the known casual-| 
ties plus the men still unaccounted 
for, 20 per cent of the B. E. F. will 


have been lost. This is a severe loss, 
and the loss of the heavy equip-| 


ment of the troops that participated | 
is perhaps an even greater one. 

But the loss is so much lighter | 
than many of the British had ex-| 
pected, that the inevitable British 
reaction must be one of relieved | 
surprise. Moreover, the losses ex- 
acted of the Germans apparently 
were considerable, and the Anzac 
and British troops undoubtedly 
proved their mettle. 

Therefore, though the British 
have unquestionably suffered a ma- | 
jor material defeat in Gieece, their | 
successful evacuation and their| 
courageous resistanceare something 


of a moral triumph. 





The escape of 48,000 fighting men| ably will

}and the course’of the war. 


ticularly

| guard 


an effect upon the fast-developing 
Mediterranean situation; the pres- 
ence of German troops in Finland 
may indicate Nazi thrusts in 
Northern Europe, which in turn 
could have a considerable impact 
upon the Mediterranean situation 
The 
latest report about Finland follows 
one from Stockholm several days 
ago that said Germany had been 
rushing large reinforcements of 
mechanized troops to Northern 


Norway. However, the implications 
of all these reports may not be 
large. 
Finns Agreed to Transit 

As long ago as last September the 
Finns agreed to permit the trans- 
port of “German troops on leave 
and of German supplies’’ between 
Finland and Norway. And shortly 
after seven shiploads of uniformed 


German soldiers had debarked at 
Vasa on the Gulf of Bothnia last 


‘September the Finns proclaimed 


the ports of Vasa, Abo (where the 
Germans are reported to have land- 
ed recently, according to the latest 
Soviet account), Uleaborg, Kemi 
and Tornea as prohibited areas, 
access to which was permitted only 


by special police permit. 
German troops, therefore, have 


been in Finland or passing through 
it for some months, just as they | 
have been passing through Sweden | 
a similar agreement with 
ever since the Nor- 


(under 
the Swedes) 
wegian conquest. 


These agreements permit ready 


reinforcements or reliefs of Ger- 


many'’s Norwegian garrisons—par- 
those in the far north— 
without the danger consequent to 
sending troops along the Norwegian 
coast by ship (and hence exposed to 
British air or sea attack) to Nar- 


| 


| vik, which is not connected to the 


Norwegian railroad network. More- 
over, Germans in Finland or pass- 
to | 
guard the supply routes from the 
Swedish iron mines, which are con-| 
nected with Norwegian Narvik by| 
railroad. These routes, in the Sum- 


mer, lead by railroad to the Gulf of | 
Bothnia and thence by ship through 


| the Baltic to Germany. 


The Germans’ position in the 
north also enables them to safe- 
their Norwegian-Swedish- 
Finnish wood-pulp supply, used for 
munitions cellulose and, if neces- | 
sary, puts them in position to act 
as a distant threat to Iceland, A 
German base in Southern Finland 
does put a German expeditionary 


force close to Russian Leningrad, 
though hundreds of miles removed 


from what the Germans want of

troops in Finland, therefore, prob-

ripples in European strategy. 


accompanied by Mr. Churchill's an-, over the coves and inlets where they 


nouncement of the extent of the} 
evacuation, emphasis was subtly | 
changed. The note suggests that) 
the British people were worried | 
about what the Greeks thought of | 
'their evacuation. As far as it is 
possible to determine here, how- 
ever, no one has thought much 
about that; what has been worry- 
ing them has been the fate of the 
Imperial troops sent into Greece. 
Leaving unanswered as it does the 
fate of several thousand soldiers, 
| Mr. Churchill’s statement, supple- 
| mented by Mr. Eden’s revelation of 
| the Greek note, offers material for | 
| the debate scheduled next week. 





Harder Than Dunkerque 

| LONDON, April 30 (UP)—Britain’s 
|} evacuation of troops from Greece 
was described today as even more 
difficult than the withdrawal from 
| Dunkerque. In Greece the German 
| Panzer divisions and air force blast- 
ed ceaselessly at the retiring Brit- 
ish forces, heavily outnumbered, all 
| the way from Mount Olympus to 
| the Peloponnesus. The R. A. F. was 





embarked. 

And to transport large numbers 
of men across the Mediterranean 
was far more difficult than the 
Channel crossing, giving a new 
demonstration of the Royal Navy’s 
superiority in that zone. 

The rescue of a majority of the 
Anzacs was expected here to quell 
criticism of Britain in Australia and 
New Zealand, where #t had been 
feared an imperial disaster was in 
the making. 

Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden 


| was asked to convey to the Greek 


Premier and authorities ‘‘deep 


| gratitude for the magnificent cour- 


age and endurance the Greek Army 


| has shown and for their loyalty as 
| allies.’’ 


“T believe the whole House feels 


| that no tribute can be too high for 
| what they achieved,’’ Mr. Eden re- 


marked. 
Coincident with Mr, Churchill’s 
announcement, London took official 


| cognizance of the German conquest 


| 


of Greece. The Board of Trade and 
Ministry of Economic Warfare an- 
nounced that all of Greece, except-

FRENCH LIST LOSS 
OF 30 NAVAL SHIPS

Have Taken Main Toll 


ACCIDENTS CLAIM THREE 


Three Others Torpedoed Off

Mysterious Submarines 


Wireless to Tae New Yorx Tres. 

VICHY, France, April 30—Losses 
of the ‘‘unbeaten” French Navy in 
the war to date have reached 
thirty vessels, including one battle- 
ship and one cruiser, according to 
statistics published today by the 
Paris-Soir. 

The actions that caused the great- 
est losses were that at Dunkerque 
and the two clashes with the Brit- 
ish Navy at Mers el-Kebir and 
Dakar—the latter two having oc- 
curred since the armistice was 
signed. Three French vessels have 
been torpedoed by unidentified sub- 
marines off Cape Juby, promontory 
in Rio de Oro, Spanish possession 
in Northwestern Africa. Three 
ships have been lost by accident. 

“The loss of these ships," 
says the newspaper, ‘‘has been a 
heavy toll to pay, but it must be 
remembered that throughout hos- 
tilities overseas trade was con- 
tinued and that since the armistice 
France has obtained considerable 
supplies through the protection of | 
the navy.”’ 

The list—it does not include ves- | 
sels damaged, such as the Richelieu | 
and the Dunkerque—follows: 

Battleship: Bretagne, sunk at/| 
Mers el-Kebir. 

Cruiser: La Tour d’Auvergne, ac- 
cident at Casablanca. 

Destroyers: Jaguar, battle of| 
Dunkerque; Chacal, battle of Dun-

tled at Brest. 

Submarines: Roland Morillot, 
Achille, Agosta and Ouessant, all 
destroyed or scuttled at Brest; 
Persée, Ajax and Poncelet, all in 
the Battle of Dakar; Sfax, tor- 
pedoed off Cape Juby; Morse, sunk 
by mine at Sfax on Tun’‘sia’s east- 
ern coast; Narval, torpedoed in

VICHY EXTENDS CURB 
ON JEWS’ ARMY RANK 


Noncommissioned Posts Closed 
to Them By New Law 


Wireless to Tx= New Yorx Trues. 
VICHY, France, April 30—An ad- 
dendum to the law of Oct. 3, 1940, 
on the status of Jews is published 


today in the Journal Officiel. It 


extends ineligibility of Jews to non- 


commissioned ranks in the army, 
navy and air force of the ‘‘army of 
the armistice,’’ which is recruited 
entirely from enlisted men. 

The original law referred only to 
commissioned ranks. Ineligibility is 
extended furthermore to adjuncts 
of the defense forces that have now 
become civilian in nature, such as 
the Medical Corps. 

On the other hand, it has been de- 
cided that Jews deprived of govern- 
ment posts by the original law who | 
are at present serving overseas or 
are prisoners of war will receive a 
respite of two months, dating from 
their return to unoccupied France 
or from their release from captivity. 

The Journal Officiel also prints a 
decision by the Minister of the 
Interior by which a Jew is ‘‘made 
officially to resign’’ the post of 
county councilor. He is Emile Aron 
of Chateau-Renault in the Indre-et- 
Loire Department. This locality is 


in the occupied zone.

Wireless to THz New YorK Times. 
CAIRO, Egypt, April 30—Serbian 
officers who took part in the resist- 
| ance in the Strumitza Valley on the 
| Yugoslav-Greek frontier say that 
the Germans employed sixty-ton 
tanks. How many has not yet been 
| ascertained, but the number is de- 
scribed as ‘‘tremendous.’’ The Serbs

top of the tanks and ‘pelted down 
hand grenades, sacrificing them-

mans are reported 
fully 150 tanks, some of which were 
sixty-tonners. The onslaught in the

[more than three miles] long, with 
vehicles massed nose to tail.

Meanwhile the fighting spirit of 
the Greeks outside the subjugated

this probably is an overly opti- 
mistic appraisal. The movement

AXIS ANNOYANCE 


IS SEEN 


Moscow Is Said to Have Told| 
Nazis Bombers in the South 
Will ‘Spray Wheat Crops’ 


By DANIEL T. BRIGHAM 

By Telephone to Taz New Yorx TIMES 

BERNE, Switzerland, April 30— 
Threatened in the south with the 
closing of the Dardanelles, because 
of a vacillating Turkey, and in 
the north by the reported recent | 
arrival of a German armored divi- | 
sion at Abo, in Finland, Russia was 
reported here today to be taking ex- | 
tensive steps for the immediate 
bolstering of already strong Soviet 
forces in the Ukraine, Poland and 
Estonia in preparation for a 
worsening of Russian-German rela- 
tions in the near future, which, it! 
is said, might even lead to war. | 

These measures are understood to 
include the rushing of another 
twenty-five Russian divisions to! 
join the reported forty already 
strung along the Dniester and 
Pruth Rivers from Lwow to Odes- 
sa. In the same region the Rus- 
sians recently amassed so much 
aviation material that it was re- 
ported a German inquiry was made 
in Moscow to ascertain the reason 
The inquirer was informed that be- 
tween 600 and 700 first-line bomb- 
ers and a considerable number of 
pursuit ships were there for the 
purpose of “‘spraying the wheat 
crops this Spring.’’ 

In Estonia it is understood no at- 
tempts are being made to conceal 
the defensive preparations of Rus- 
sian long-range artillery on the 
southern shores of the Gulf of Fin- 
land. With approximately twenty 
divisions in the neighborhood, the 
Russian High Command is under- 
stood to be moving another fifteen 
to twenty to protect its newly ac- 
quired territories of Latvia, Estonia 
and Lithuania. 


Reported Joining Russians 


Meanwhile in the seized Polish 
territory the Russians are under- 
stood to have won over ‘‘a consid- 
erable number’ of the conquered 
Poles in Russian-occupied terri- 
tory, who are reported to have 
joined Russian ranks in the hopes 
of getting revenge for the German 
assault on their territory—freely 
promised by local Russian com- 
manders. 

The fact that most of these Rus- 
Sian reinforcements consist of 
strong regiments drawn from the 
Far East has led to speculation in 
diplomatic quarters here as to the 
exact extent of the ‘‘published’’ 
Russo-Japanese pact of mutual 
friendship and non-aggression. Most 
quarters here feel that it provided 
a welcome escape for the Japanese 
Government, whose Foreign Minis- 
ter, during his stay in Europe, wit- 
nessed several Axis rebuffs. 

The Russian concentration of the 
main reinforcements in the south, 
however, interpreted here as a 
measure of the gravity with which 
Russia regards the German occu- 
pation of the islands of Lemnos and 
Samothrace following the collapse 
of Greek resistance. From these 
positions German forces not only 
could threaten an intransigent 
Turkey with aerial attacks but 
could bottle up any Russian fleet 
bent on operating in the Mediter- 
ranean from the Black Sea. 

It further shows the importance 
that the Russian High Command 
attaches to the possibility of Ger- 
many’s re-employing the famous 
‘“‘Hoffman Plan’’ used so successful- 
ly by Generals Hoffman and von 
Mackensen in 1917 against the Rus- 
sians. That plan envisaged an en- 
veloping operation of the Russian 
armies in the Ukraine by simul- 
taneous pushes from the north and 
south and, only if these operations 
progressed, a direct frontal attack 
from the west. The success of these 
operatiens resulted in the Treaty of 
Brest-Litovsk in March, 1918. 

Russian apprehension is further 
heightened by an increasingly acri- | 
monious tone in the Axis press in

troops on leave to and from Nor- 
way. All the troops arriving at 
Abo have been unarmed, it was 
stated.) 

It was the first time that the 
Soviet press ever had taken cog- 
nizance of such a development. The 
continued presence of German 
troops in Finland would forge a| 
new link in the Nazi chain around | 


| Russia, following the German oc-| 


|cupation of Rumania and Bulgaria 


and the German advance through | 
Yugoslavia and Greece to the! 
islands off the Dardanelles. | 

The news came, too, just after a 
notice published in the magazine 
Foreign Trade had disclosed that | 
the transit of war matériel across | 


| Russia had been forbidden since | 


| 











A dispatch telling of the arri- | 
val of 12,000 German troops at 
Abo, Finland, (1) was published 
in Moscow. Russia was reported 
to be strengthening her forces 
in Northern Estonia (2) and 
along the Dniester and Pruth 
Rivers (3), between Lwow and 
Odessa, Black Sea port. 





its references to the Soviet Union. 
According to one report reaching 
this capital tonight, several German 
newspapers and one Italian paper | 
this afternoon, after sarcastically 
referring to Russia's repeated state- | 
ments she ‘‘wished to preserve Eu- 
rope from a further extension of 
the conflict,’’ listed the following 
five actions on the part of the Mos- 
cow government, qualifying each as 
a deliberate attempt to disturb the 
“construction of a new order in 
Europe.” 

1. Repeated conversations in Lon- | 
don between Ivan Maisky, Soviet 
Ambassador, and Anthony Eden, | 
British Foreign Secretary, which | 
the Axis interprets as indicating a} 
hostile attitude on the part of Mos- 
cow, which held to be desirous | 
of entering into ‘‘a closer alliance |

2. The Russian assurances to Tur- | 
key on the eve of the Vienna visit 
of Dragisha Cvetkovitch and Dr. | 
Alexander Cincar-Markovitch, for- 
mer Yugoslav Premier and Foreign 
Minister, respectively, to adhere to 
the Axis pact. The reported exten- 
sion of Russian-Turkish exchanges, 
which Berlin allegedly interprets as 
directed against herself, further 
irritates the Axis papers. 

3. The Russian-Yugoslav agree- 
ment of non-aggression and mutual | 
friendship, signed in Moscow a bare 
three hours before the German on- 
slaught against Yugoslavia, was | 
entered into, according to these | 
papers, despite Russian knowledge 
of the impending German action. | 
It was interpreted as a deliberate | 
and calculated act of ‘‘passive hos- | 
tility.’”’ 





4. Russia’s sharp accusation that? 


Budapest should ‘‘be ashamed of | 
itself’’ for attacking a country with | 
which it had just concluded a non-| 
aggression pact and the subsequent | 
polemics in the world press were, | 
according to the Axis charges, *‘de- | 
liberately engineered to put the 
worst possible interpretation on a} 
delicate situation.”’ 

5. Russia’s repeated 
keep Bulgaria in 
her from gravitating to “her nat- | 
ural allies, the Axis powers,’’ are | 
not interpreted as the outcome of | 
normal Russian apprehension at | 
German expansion in the Balkans | 
and the Middle East, but as an un-| 
warranted intérference in ‘‘Ger- 
many’s sphere of influence.”

A dispute over the respective neuw- | 


trality of Sweden and Finland, con- 
tinuing in 
press of both countries, was termed 
‘‘a duel in the dark’’ today by the 
conservative Helsinki 
Uusi Suomi. 

“Tt is not even possib!» to men- 
tion all things by their right names, 
or to speak of making public con- 
crete factors bearing on the mat- 
ter,’ the newspaper observed 
cryptically. 

It went on to explain that Fin- 
land’s precarious international sta- 
tus dictated a ‘‘realistic policy,’ re- 
sulting in differences of foreign re- 
lations that the Swedes find it hard 
to understand. 

‘‘While the Swedes feel they have 
room for discussion of principles,”’ 
the paper continued, ‘‘we must con- 
centrate all our attention on one 
basic problem—namely, securing 
the very existence of our people.’’ 

Uusi Suomi, nevertheless, 
pressed the belief that ‘‘Finnish-

“Nothing Known” in Berlin 
BERLIN, April 30 (UP)—Autho- 


ing is known here’ regarding Mos- 


moved into Finland. 


Finnish Envoy Explains 


The Finnish Government cabled 
here yesterday ‘‘emphatically and 
categorically’? denying Moscow re- 
ports that 12,000 German troops 


landed in Finland, according to a 
statement by Hjalmar J. Procope, | 
Finnish Minister to the United 
States. He made the statement dur- 
ing a visit yesterday afternoon to 


Finland, at 522 Fifth Avenue. 

Dr. Procope also denied that 
Carl Mannerheim of the Finnish 
Army had asked for German troops, 
and that there had been a cooling 
of Swedish-Finnish relations be- 
cause of a strong pro-German trend 
in Finland, 

According to Dr. Procope, the ap- 
parent basis of the report regarding 
the landing of German troops was 
the passage of unarmed German 
troops through Finland as per- 
mitted by a transit agreement made 
last Fall. He said a total of fewer 
than 1,300 unarmed soldiers had ar- 
rived in Abo. Ordinarily, he ex- 
plained, German troops passing 
through Finland for Northern Nor- 


this Spring the regular route across 
the Gulf of Bothnia, north of Abo, 
had been blocked by pack-ice.

“It is recalled,’’ Dr. Pyocope con- 
tinued, “that Finland last Autumn | 
concluded transit agreements be ad 
Russia and Germany concerning | 
goods and unarmed troops. These! 
agreements are local and, in the 
case of Germany, occasional, and 
mainly corresponding to a similar 
agreement Sweden made some| 
months earlier concerning the tran- | 
sit of German troops to Norway. 

“It may be added that the num-

Sweden Fears Trend 


By Telephone to THe New Yoru TIMes. 

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, April 30— 
An editorial in the conservative 
Svenska Dagbladett allows the con- 
troversy between the Swedish and 
Finnish press to be placed in its 
true perspective. 

The controversy was inadvertently 
started nine days-ago by the same 
newspaper when it wrote that ‘‘as 
long as Finland firmly follows the 
policy of neutrality the destiny of 
the two countries will remain 
uniteda.”’ 

The Stockholm Dagens Nyheter 
feels that the effects of propaganda 
“can be particularly observed in 
circles especially receptive to the 
revenge sentiment and fantastic 
promises of gains in case of an 
eventual expansion of the war. 

In short, it all comes down to 
the fact that Finnish circles who 
were silent until recently are rais- 
ing their voices because they be- 
lieve in the inevitability of a Russo- 
German war and want to drag their 
country in on Berlin’s side to better 
from a German victory, 
which they are convinced would 
result.

Another public voice

who told the press that he saw ‘‘no 
reason to oppose Mr. Matsuoka's 
visit to the United States and 
should like to urge him to go.”’ 

But Mr. Tsurumi thought the 
visit should be shorn of all political

The newspaper Hochi bluntly

Pan Auiettoun Airways Goes Into Singapore; RESERVE OFFICERS 


TRIP BY MATSUOKA 


THURSDAY, MAY 1, 


Flights | to Alternate With Hong Kong Run Run -FAGE ‘WEEDING OUT 


Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Per- 
mission to operate a service be- 
tween Manila and Singapore in con- 
nection with its trans-Pacific serv- 
ice was granted the Pan American 
Airways today by the Civil Aero- 
nautics Board. 

At present Pan American Airways 
operates a service from Manila to 
Hong Kong on a weekly schedule. 
The C. A. B. expressed the opinion 
that Pan American could operate 
flights to Singapore on alternate 
weeks. 

The operative schedule would 
make it possible to fly from San 
Francisco to Singapore in less than 
a week. The journey now takes 
twenty-seven days by steamship. 

A certificate issued to Pan Amer- 
ican for the Singapore service grants 
permission to operate over the 
Manila-Singapore route for a period 
of five years. It is an amendment 
to the certificate under which Pan 
American is now authorized to fly 
from San Francisco to Honolulu, 
the islands of Midway, Wake and 
Guam, to Manila and thence to the 
Portuguese colony of Macao and 
Hong Kong. 


The first plane to fly Pan Amer- 
ican Airways’ new route is to leave 
San Francisco tomorrow (Friday). 

The new service, it is pointed out, 
will give the first direct link by air 
between this country and Singapore, 
from which it is not 
reach important areas such as Brit- 
ish India and the Netherlands 
Indies. 

Although the announcement by 
the airway did not touch upon the 
defense aspect of the service, the 
strategic importance of the exten- 
sion was regarded, in circles fa- 
miliar with problems of aviation, 
as coordinate with the commercial

The American service will be 
maintained to both Singapore and 
Hong Kong, by alternation of these 
cities as terminals. The crossing to 
Singapore is to be made from Ma- 
nila, by clipper planes capable of 
flying the distance in about six and

on the stock market, which the Axis | 


victories are unable to overcome. 

Mr. Ishii today characterized the 
extension of the naval patrol as 
“very dangerous and tending in the 
direction of aggression’’ and em- 
phasized that Jap n did not see any 
necessity for such a patrol in the 
Pacific. 

But, he added, whether any inci- 
dent that might occur as a result 
would be judged by Japan as ‘‘ag- 
gression”’ involving Japan’s obliga- 
tions under the Three-Power Pact 
would depend on the circumstances 
and on ‘‘which side begins the 
shooting.*’

Watson’s Letter States Case 


The part of General Watson's let- 
ter to General Johnson made pub- | 
lic by Mr. Early read as follows: 

‘‘The President has read your let-| 
ter and has asked me to say that} 


| personalities had no place in his| ; pec 
| fully submit that withholding it in 


| these circumstances is neither very 


decision not to reappoint you to a 
reserve commission. 

‘The President feels very strong- | 
ly that in the present emergency re- | 
appointment of general officers who 
are eligible by age to perform active 
service should be restricted to those | 
whose appointment on such service | 


|is anticipated, and that only after |

Japanese | 


the physical fitness of the officer 


| has been investigated to the satis- 


faction of the Army medical author- | 
ities. 

“The War Department does not} 
plan to place you on active duty | 
and, in view of this fact, your re-| 
appointment would be to no pur-| 
pose. The question was simply 
whether in the present emergency | 
you and others within the age limit | 
for active duty should be reappoint- 
ed to what would amount to a pure- 
ly honorary rank without actual 
significance.”’ 


Text of Johnson Letter 


Mr. Early said that General John- 
son would have to be the one to 
make public his own earlier letter 
to the President. General Johnson 
subsequently did so and it read: 

“T talked to Pa Watson about the 
following last night, but fear I 
didn’t make it clear. I have been 
a Reserve brigadier general for 
fifteen years—three terms of five 
years each. The last expired April 
10. The War Department submitted 
to the White House my nomination 
for reappointment several days 
earlier. -It stopped there. 

‘“T am 58. End of the term of 
reappointment would not find me 
at the retirement age, 64. Neither 
physical nor professional examina- 
tion was required. As to the mental 
examination, it is waived in all 
cases and there would probably be 
no occasion to call me to active 
duty except in some line of my 
special experience—mobilization of 
manpower or industry. 

“‘As to physical condition, there 
is no trouble except that I am over- 
weight. It is unimportant because 
I could not assume active duty 
without a physical examination 
anyway. 

A call to active duty would be a 
erious problem to me. With a con- 
siderably increased income, greatly 
increased personal obligations have 
been assumed—mostly to invalid and 
dependent relatives which I could} 


| nothing to me of either 


‘of disqualifying me to serve my 


|}country if an appropriate occasion 


should arise nor the heart to do so. 
The reserve commission means 
prestige 
or advantage—nothing at all other- 
wise except a standing one-way 
ticket to potential grief. I respect- 


stent with what 
close and 


wise nor very con 
at least used to be a very 


| precious friendship. 


“P, S.: May I emphasize again 
that it seems to me that I am not 
here asking for any favor to myself 
and to recall that throughout o 
entire association I never did.”’ 

In his written 
public coincidentally, Gen 
son added 

“IT have no criticism or complaint 
about the President's failure 
new upon my application my third 
five-year term as Brigadier General 
in the Regular Army Reserve. No 
man has a right to demand such an 


made 
eral John- 


statement 


appointment any more than he has | 
to be consecrated asa Bishop. That | 


is the President's business as Com- 
mander in Chief, and no good sol- 
dier would have a word to say. 

As a matter of fact, acceptance 
of a Reserve commission is just an 
expression of willingness 
at the call of the President in a 
particular grade. My condition is 
altered only in this that my govern- 
ment gave me both my military and 
legal education and every chance I 
ever had in life. I would serve it 
at any moment, at any call, 
grade from corporal—up or down. 

Mr. Early 
velt thought there should be a re- 
tired list for Reserve officers in the 
Army as there is in the Navy. No 
legislation to make this 
however, is on the statute books, 
the Executive aide remarked.

One Shoots Down Nazi Raider 
at Plymouth, Where High 
Death Toll Is Feared 


By DAVID ANDERSON 
Special Cable to THe New YorxK TIMES. 
LONDON, Thursday, May 1— 

While Plymouth was being at-| 
tacked here, British bombers on | 
Tuesday night made a raid in force | 
upon Mannheim, key commercial 
and industrial city in 
Germany. A incendiary | 
bombs preceded many tons of high 
explosive bombs, including ‘‘some 
of the largest and most powerful | 
types.’’ These presumably are the 
new the British 


layer of 


heavy bombs that 
have brought into use 

The Air Ministry 
fires were plentiful both on the| 
docks and in the town of Mann- 
heim itself. That last bit of infor- 
mation carries more than a sugges- 
tion that German civilians have 
been made aware of what is 
going on 

The intense blackness of the night 
bothered the first British pilots ar- 
riving Clusters of flares were 
sent down and soon were reflected 
in the winding silver ribbon of the 
Rhine. Thereafter it was a rela- 
tively simple matter for the pilots 
to get their bearings 

The fire bombs took up the work 
lighting Mannheim from _ the 


reports that 


| Bombing became a question of 
blaze into which to 
Searchlight bat- 
teries managed to box several Brit- 
ish planes and at least one was 
engaged by Messerschmitt fighters. 
|}It was hit, but escaped later after 


a sharp exchange of fire. 
Oil Supplies Attacked 


The Royal Air Force also attacked 
Rotterdam One 
British aircraft failed to return 
from these operations. 

During the daylight on Tuesday 
bombers, escorted by 


fighters, concentrated on enemy 


shipping, successfully setting fire 


to a supply vessel of 5,000 tons and 
damaging a number of others. 

It was announced yesterday that 
planes of the Bomber Command 
operating in daylight had sunk or 
damaged 42,000 tons of enemy ship- | 


| ping off the coasts of Germany, the 


Netherlands, France and Norway 


| during the week of April 17 to 23. 


The water-borne 
tacked moves 


trade thus at- 
cautiously, seldom | 


|}more than two or three miles from | 


the shore. It is usully under the 


| protection of destroyers or ‘‘flak’’ 
| ships, 


bristling with anti-aircraft 
weapons. Less than a week ago 
Britain lost four bombers that ran 
into a nest of these warships. 


American Planes Used 


Details are given out on the per- 
formance of the American-built 
‘“‘Havuc”’ of the British Fighter 
Command, a version of the ‘‘Bos- 
ton’’ medium bomber. One of these 
planes shot down one of the Ger- 
man raiders at Plymouth on Tuesday 
night. An official report states 
‘“‘a force of these aircraft’’ 
carried out successful attacks upon 
three enemy air fields in Northern 
Franc2. They swooped down from 
the night sky while German raiders 
were landing and raked the fields 
with machine-gun fire, scattered 
incendiaries and high explosives, 
fought off defending enemy aircraft 
and made their way safely home 
again 

Evidence of the extent to which 
the civilian population in Britain is 
bearing the brunt of the war was 
offered yesterday by Ernest Brown, 
Minister of Health, who said that 
altogether 29,000 persons had been 
killed as the result of bombing and 
40,000 injured up to the end of 
March. 

While hospitals and kindred pub- 


|lic institutions get wide attention 


when they are hit, it is a fact that 
they have a good record for safety. 
Taking 400 of them in Greater Lon-| 


}don the casualties among patients 


amount to 235 killed and 195 in-| 
jured, most of the latter slightly.

Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES. 


SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND, 
April 30--The British High Com- 
mand, which is forever alert 
against invasion of this country, 
has learned new ‘lessons about 


methods of repulsing any enemies | 


who attempt to land in force in 
Britain as a result of large-scale ex- 
ercises just completed in 
Anglia. 

Seventy-five thousand officers and 
men aid 10,000 vehicles, long lines 
of various types of tanks, impudent 
and speedy little scout cars, supply 
trucks, other motorized equipment, 
troop-cirrying airplanes, theoret- 
ical enemy parachutists and fifth 
columnists took part in the exer- 
cise, which embraced an area of 
1,600 square miles. 

The parachutists included two 
United States volunteers, whose 
identity was strictly withheld. 

The exercises, which were realis- 
tic down to the last detail, cover- 
ing everything except actual shoot- 
ing, resulted in a demonstration of 
how a real invader could, in the 
eyes of high British officers at least, 
be driven off with severe losses. 
However, as in all military 
noeuvres, 
1939, there 
some mistakes, but as a result of 
these commanding officers drew 
important conclusions, which, they 
said, have enabled them to evolve 
still more efficient ways and means 
of combating hostile that 
might try to effect a landing in

troops 


Attack by Four Divisions 
The exercises began last Saturday 
when, theoretically, four divisions 
troops landed on the 
Eastern coast. It was assumed that 


|} two of these divisions were wiped | 


out in attempting to land, leaving 
two others—one armored 
the other mobile artillery and in- 
fantrymen—to try to swing down to 
London. Tough and highly trained 
men, especially picked as attackers, 
and equally well-trained defenders 
engaged in the ensuing ‘‘battle.”’ 
The ratio of defenders to attackers 
vas about two to one 

For days and nights both sides 
were on the move, ‘‘fighting des- 
perately,’’ as they would in actual 
combat, going without adequate 


|rest and eating cold sandwiches at 


intervals, and while airplanes 
roared overhead long columns of 
tanks and infantrymen filled hun- 
dreds of miles of roadways in what 
in peacetime would be a sleepy 


countryside. 


During the first phase of the in- 
vasion the attackers bored their 


| way steadily inward from the East 


coast, driving the defenders back. 
Throughout Saturday night and the 
early hours of Sunday, various vil- 
lages were defended stubbornly by

Meanwhile—so complete were the 
details of the exercises worked 
out—two German-speaking British 
officers, posing as fifth columnists, 
were allowed to go at large behind 
the British lines. Home Guards-} 
men, after examining their creden- 
tials and discovering flaws in them, | 
quickly turned them over to the 
police, who in turn immediately 
notified military authorities, and 
step by step, in rapid succession, 
these ‘‘spies’’ were transported all 
along the line until they were soon | 
put out of harm’s way. 


Headquarters ‘‘Captured’”’ 


Another realistic touch was 
dropping of a number of “‘hostile’ 
parachute troops far behind the de-| 
fending lines. These men managed 
to capture rear headquarters in | 
short order, but they themselves | 
were soon taken prisoner by British 
scouts, whereupon advance head- 
quarters breathed more easily

countered fierce opposition many

tack, the fifth in 
the last nine nights. The severity 
of the latest raid lay in the weak- 
ened condition of the town, and it is 
feared that the loss of life will prove 
to have been heavy. 

Five German bombers were shot 
down by anti-aircraft crews and an- 
three destroyed by British 
fighters in the course of the night. 

This makes a total of night suc- | 
cesses for April eighty-eight, which 
is easily a record for a single 


month since the war began, A fifth 
of them are credited to fighter 
planes. Altogether the German Air

Special to THe New York TIMES. 


night marking the formation of the 
American Palestine Committee, 
called for encouragement and cheer 
“to those who are manning the 
rampart of freedom which Palestine 
has become today.”’ 

Addressing more than 200 mem- 
bers of Congress, Cabinet officers, | 
religious leaders and guests from 
all walks of life, the Senate’s ma- 
jority leader said that the new 
committee’s members represented 
the overwelhing sentiment of the| 
American people in favor of en-| 
dorsement of the Jewish national 
home. 

Other speakers were Dr. Chaim 
Weizmann, president of the World 
Zionist Organization; Senator Bur- 
ton of Ohio, and Major Victor A.! 
Cazalet, M. P., chairman of the 
Palestine Committee in the House 
of Commons. Senator Wagner of 
New York, chairman of the Ameri- | 
can Palestine Committee, was un- 
able to be present; he sent a state- | 
ment in which he said that the in- | 
tention of the committee was ‘‘to 
speak to the conscience of America 
and of all Christians.’’ 

Senator Barkley voiced a special 
welcome to Dr. Weizmann and Ma-| 
jor Cazalet as coming ‘‘from that 
citadel of democracy and human | 
freedom—the capital of Great Brit- 
ain and the British Commonwealth 
—which is today standing up with 
unparalleled heroism against the on- 
slaught of the brutal forces of bar- 
barism.”’ 

He spoke of the overrunning of 
small nations which wanted only | 
“to live their lives,’’ and added: 

“America looks forward to the | 
day when those small nations will | 
again be restored to their rightful 
heritage. | 
‘“‘And who will say that in this re- | 
storation of the smaller nations to 
which we look forward the Jewish |

Dr. Weizmann told the gathering 
that the Jewish problem in Europe 
would not be solved automatically 
| even by the re-establishment of dem- 
ocratic regimes. 

Millions of Jews, torn from their 
accustomed economic fabric, would | 
| have to be assisted, said Dr. Weiz- |

ECUADOR PLEDGES 


FULL AID T0 U. §. 


President Arroyo Says Pan- 
American Cooperation Must 
Include Military Action 


GALAPAGOS ISSUE PENDING 


Question of a Seaplane Base 
Unsettled, but Canal Pro- 
tection Is Assured 


By HAROLD CALLENDER 

By Air Mail to Tas NEw Yorx Tres. 
QUITO, Ecuador, April 26—In 
reply to questions as to the role 
Ecuador intended to play in the 


defense of the Americas in view of | 


her position within the strategic 
sphere of the Panama Canal, Dr. 
Carlos A. Arroyo del Rio, President 


of this republic, in a statement to | 
this writer said Pan-American co- | 


operation must include military ac- 
tion and that Ecuador, ‘‘with its 


broad and sincere American spirit, | 


will not refuse its aid in the service 
of American ideals.’’ 

Dr. Arroyo thus implied that his 
government, like the Colombian, 


was conscious of the peculiar situa- | 


tion of the countries close to the 
canal and realized the need of spe- 
cial vigilance. But he did not reply 
directly to the question regarding 
United States naval] protection for 


Ecuador’s shores and Ecuador’s is- | 
where the | 


lands, the Galapagos, 
Navy desires a seaplane base—as 
Admiral F. H. Sadler, commanding 
the naval forces at Panama, ex- 
plained to this correspondent re- 
cently. The President did not agree 
with Dr. Alfonso Lopez, prospective 
President of Colombia, that bases 
should be frankly discussed without 
delay. 
Minister Pledges Support 
The Ecuadorian Foreign Minister, 


Dr. Julio Tobar Donoso, was more | 


ouespoken when, in reply to a simi- 
lar question, he said: 

“The Panama Canal is a conti- 
nental asset, a kind of collective 
patrimony of the countries around 
it. Consequently, its defense is a 
special interest of these countries, 


almost as much as of the United | 


States. Therefore, if the case arises, 
Ecuador will contribute to this de- 
fense all the support compatible 
with her position, her competence 
and her obligations as a sovereign 
State. My country will never be- 

udge or haggle about any sacri- 
ice in the interest of continental 


AAA TA LT ANT AU 


legitimate and in accordance with 
its institutions.’’ 

The President, in his interview, 
| went on to say that Pan-American- 
ism was ‘‘not an artificial or arbi- 
trary creation but a response to the 
| reality of common interests, ante- 
|cedents and problems and a com- 
mon future for the peoples of this 
continent.”’ 

From this reality arose, he said, 
|*‘the inescapable necessity ‘of co- 
| operation, whose form must be de- 


| sottdarity and cooperation which is 


| termined as events present them-| 


| selves.”’ 
| Dr. Arroyo thought this coopera- | 
| tion could not be specified in detail | 
in advance, but that ‘‘this much is| 
|certain: The sooner it comes and 
| the broader it is, the bette: will it 
serve the desired end.”’ 

“If we seek to create an artificial 
| link between the peoples of Amer- 
ica the time of doing so may de- 
pend upon opportunity; but if those 
links exist, latent and potent, any 
|moment is opportune for translat- 
ing them into facts,’’ he continued. 

Advocates Wide Cooperation 

“‘Cooperation of all the peoples of 
America ought to include all the 
aspects of their community of inter- 
|esteconomic, military, moral, in- 
tellectual, according as circum- 
stances offer. 

“For Ecuador, who has given 
| proofs of her desire for internation- 

al harmony, it may be said there is 
| only one pending problem: the set- 
|tlement of the territorial question 
with the neighboring republic, 
Peru, a question whose solution has 
been delayed Jor more than a cen- 
tury. 

‘‘Where suspicion or resentment 
exists complete cooperation is diffi- 
cult. The solution of the problem 
between Ecuador and Peru is a con- 
tinental issue of interest to all 
America. Ecuador has constantly 
sought to settle it on a basis of jus- 
tice and right. 


THE NEW YORK TIMES, THURSDAY, MAY 1, 1941, 


| Ecuadorian Catholics sympathize 
| with anti-democratic forces,’ he 
| said. “I am sure, on the contrary, 
| that many of them, particularly the 
|most representative and enlight- 
} ened, are genuine supporters of de- 
|mocracy; certainly they favor an 
| organic democracy in both the po- 
litical and social spheres. Their 
program finds its inspiration in the 
| principles of Christian democracy 
}so brilliantly expounded by Leo 
XIII and Pius XI. 

“There are, of course, Catholic 
sympathizers with the Spanish Fa- 
lange, not because of the political 
ideas it may hold or its aspirations 
to give a fixed form to the Spanish 
State, but rather because it has 
been one of the most important 
|forces for the reconstruction of 
| Spain, whose greatness profoundly 
|interests her daughter republics, 
|and because of the triumph over 
| bolshevism and irreligion. 

“IT consider that the religious dif- 
| ferences between South and North 
| America are not and cannot be an 
|insuperable barrier against conti- 
| nental unity. In the United States, 
there are 25,000,000 Catholics ad- 
|mirably organized and possessing a 
social dynamism. It is to be hoped 
they will be imitated in South 

America. Moreover, the genius of 
iMberty peculiar to the American 
Constitution is an example for the 
other republics of this continent, 
which sometimes tend to imitate 
| foreign persecution and Jacobinism. 

‘‘The Catholics of North America 
| have understood the providential 
| role falling to them to contribute to 
American democracy, the founda- 
|tion and the spiritual leavening 
which it requires to extend its 








beneficent influence, its spirit of 
ardent and complete faith, in South 
America. If the cultural relations 
between the Catholics of the United 
States and those of Latin America 
are intensified, unity will become 
still more efficacious and invinci- 
ble.”’ 

(When Dr. Tobar speaks of ‘‘con- 
tinental unity,’’ he means what 
North Americans mean by ‘‘hemi- 
spheric unity.’’) 


Sees Defense Problems Solved 


‘“‘All Ecuadorians, regardless of 
their politics or religion,’’ the For- 
eign Minister continued, ‘‘recognize 
the ties and duties of mutual as- 
sistance and collaboration which 
history, geography, identity of in- 
stitutions and similarity of interna- 
tional ideals have created between 
our American peoples and the Unit- 
ed States. I believe there are no 
differences of opinion on this point, 
and I am convinced that for this 
reason all the problems of defense 
which may arise will be successfully 
solved. 

‘“‘Ecuador has enormous resources 


jin raw materials and unexploited 


wealth, and she vitally needs capi- 
tal. The United States, with its 
great economic potentialities and 
especially its spirit of community, 
represented by the good-neighbor 
policy, is naturally one of the na- 
tions which can provide the neces- 
sary means of utilizing these still 
latent sources of prosperity for the 
common good. Eouador has begun 
to do this for herself and for the 
benefit of friendly States. This 
naturally strengthens the ties be- 
tween nations and imposes mutual 
aid, which can be extremely fruit- 
ful for the continent.’’ 


FLINT & HORNER QUALITY IN 


“During the negotiations in Wash-

Dr. Tobar, the Foreign Minister, 
is the only Conservative in a Lib-

present post in the last four gov- 
ernments. Since he is a Conserva-

Farming Out Program to Be 
Expanded Through Clinics 
in Different Cities 


Special to THE NEW YorK TIME 
ALBANY, N. Y., April 30—A sur- 
vey of the present and potential so- 
cial and economic resources of the 
State of New York which can be 
adapted to the purpose of national 
defense was made public today in 
a report of the State Planning 
Council concerning the activities of 
the Division of State 
from July 1, 1940, to April 30 

Through an act of the last Legis- 
lature, the Division of State Plar 
ning, headed by Maurice F. Ne 
feld, acting director, is to be incor- 
porated tomorrow in the new Di- 
vision of Commerce, which is to ir 
clude bureaus of industry, publicit 
and planning The determinatior 
of the Stz 3 resources is being es 
tablished on a constantly expanding 
scale by the research staff of the 
Planning Division, working in co 
operation with the Department « 
Labor and other State departments 
and agencies, industrial interests 
and unofficial groups and 
viduals 

The principal accomplishments of 
the division during the last 
months jncluded the preparation of 
an Industrial Directory of New York 
State which has proved itself valu 
able for governmental and private 
business; an inventory of private 
plants; the preparation, with’the cx 
operation of local defense councils 
of an inventory of machine tool 
facilities of the State, which has 
already resulted in the farming out 
of much production for defense pur 
poses, and the publication of a 341- 
page statistical analysis of recent 
trends in manufacturing industries 
here as compared with those of 
other States. 

Dr. M. P. Catherwood, chairman 
of the council, illustrated the part 
which New York’s resources are 
playing in relation to preparedness 
by describing some of the work of 
the State-wide machine tool inven- 
tory. 

The division distributed 40,000 
questionnaires among local defense 
councils to be used by them in 
gathering information on manufac- 
turing facilities in their communi- 
ties, including data on the closest 
tolerance to which each company 
Was accustomed to work metal 
products; exact information on the 
type, the number, name, mode! o1 
capacity, age and condition of each 
machine, and the total machine 
hours available per 24-hour day 

Despite the detailed information 
required, responses were prompt, 
and the first thousand question- 
naires returned showed a total of 
134,500 machine hours per day 
available for defense sub-contract- 
ing work. 

To hasten and expand further the 
program of farming out defense 
production work, the division has 
completed,plans for sub-contracting 
clinics to be held throughout the 
State.

SMALL CRAFT FOR BRITISH | 


Craft of Torpedo-boat Type 
Will Be Supplied Out of New 
Construction, He Says 


By CHARLES HURD 
Bpecial to THs New Yorx Timer 

WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
American Navy needs every ship it 
has afloat at this time and con- 
templates no further transfers to 
Great Britain, Frank Knox, Secre- | 
tary of the Navy, said at a press 
conference today. 

He stated, however, that 
craft of the torpedo-boat type would 
be supplied out of new construction 
for Britain. A request for twenty- 
four such speedy small craft was 
expected ‘“‘hourly’”’ from the British 
Government, it was added by Rear 
Admiral S. M. Robinson, chief of 
the Bureau of Ships, who assisted 
Secretary Knox at today’s con- 
ference. 

Mr. Knox declined to reply to a 
question whether maintenance of | 
the status quo of the fleet was due 
to implications of vital need by this 
country for its defense forces, but 
he added: 

‘Everybody in this room 
oughly familiar with the fact that 
there is a possibility of war. There 
is always a possibility of war. I am 
not commenting on its imminence.” 


Combat Strength Increased 


This statement was made after 
the Secretary and Admiral Robin- 
son had comprehensively reviewed 
additions being made to the fleet 
and its activities, which developed 
the following points: 

1. The Navy’s combat strength on 
April 12 was materially larger than 
on Jan. 1, 1940. 

2. The remaining inactive force 
of the Fleet Division of the Organ- 
ized Reserves, numbering 230 of- 
ficers and 4,600 men, will be called 
into active service between May 5 
and May 30. 

3. The Navy is studying the prob- 
lem of absorbing all seagoing ves- 
sels and activities of the Coast 
Guard. 

4. The Navy has made ‘‘a change 
in plans’’ and probably will not hold | 
the annual fleet manoeuvres, but | 
now is ‘‘doing much the same 
work.”’ 

5. The building program and con- 
version of merchant ships into 
auxiliaries is progressing satisfac- 
torily. 

Incidentally, Admiral Robinson re- 
vealed that British insistence upon 
changes in design of the new batch 
of twenty-four torpedo boats, to 
supplement twenty PT boats al- 
ready sent under the lease-lend pro- 
gram, would delay the delivery of 
thecraft. This country could easily 
build and deliver twenty-four of its 
own type within twelve months, 
Admiral Robinson said, but the | 
British specifications would require 
retooling and redesigning that 
would delay delivery for a consid- 
erable period. 


Sees “iew Records for Speed 


Secretary Knox issued a statement 
at the start of his conference in 
which he denounced the ‘‘misunder- 
standing’’ created by counting new 
ships only in the number of keels 
laid. 

“The building of the greatest 
naval force in the world,’’ he said 
‘is setting up new records for speed 
and coordination ”’ 

The gist of his statement was con- 
tained in two short tables, one deal- 
ing with the combat strength of the, 
Navy anc the other giving totals of 
auxiliary types under construction. 
In each case the comparisons were | 
made between Jan. 1, 1940, and/ 
April 12, 1941. 

The Secretary listed comparative 
combat strength by types as fol- 
lows:

Battleships peebesionie 1 | 
Aircraft carriers pee sn weve 5 6 
Cruisers 37 
Destroyers 1% 
Submarines 107 


Totals 320 
The drop in , total destroyers was 
due to the delivery of fifty over-| 
age destroyers to Great Britain and | 


the transfer of thirty into classifi- | 
eation as ‘‘special-purpose’’ vessels. 


Comparison of Auxiliary Craft 


The same comparison in auxil- 
jary types follows:

Status of Ships 1940

a Se 6asene : 7 
Water-borne . aa » 8 
Work actually started . 15 


As demonstrating the progress 
made in the naval building pro- 
gram, Mr. Knox said that the Mare 
Island Navy Yard in California 
was so far ahead of its original 
schedule that it had received allo- 
eations for the building of two new | 
submarines, of 3,525 tons each, to | 
cost $6,083,000 each, The yard, he| 
said, was from two months to a/ 
year ahead of its various building | 
schedules. Seven submarines now! 
are under construction there. 

The conversion of ships from mer- | 
chantmen to specialist vessels serv- 
ing the fleet had not progressed as 
fast as had been hoped, Admiral 
Robinson said, largely because of 
unforeseen problems in the train- 
ing of personnel to do this work. 

He added, however, that work on | 
this was proceeding satisfactorily. | 
Secretary Knox interjected a re-| 
mark that if this country should | 
become involved in war it could, of | 
course, take over a considerable | 
amount of shipping now operated | 
privately. 

Secks Coast Guard Vesescis

THE DAY IN WASHINGTON 


Special to Tae. New Yorx Trues. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Pres- 
ident Roosevelt talked with Anna 
Rosenberg, Budget Director Har- 
old Smith, Charles Palmer, Ad- 
ministrator of Defense Housing; 
Maritime Commissioner Rear Ad- 
miral Emory 8. Land and Harry 
Hopkins. 

Lunch at the White House was 
in honor of President Elie Lescot 
of Haiti and his staff. 

The Senate was in recess. Its 
Foreign Relations Committee re- 
fused to report either of two anti- 
convoy resolutions, while the 
Banking and Currency Committee 
received the President’s request 
to extend his authority to devalue 
the dollar and operate a stabiliza- 
tion fund. 

The House heard Representative 
Hamilton Fish, Republican of 
New York, attack the President 
and the neutrality patrol; received 
the Gerlach bill authorizing trans- 
fer of fifty more destroyers io 
Britain; received the Sauthoff 
easy-payment tax plan and ad- 
journed at 4:55 P. M. until noon

BERLIN, April 30 (#)—Ships | 
traveling in the war zones defined 
by Germany ‘‘do so at their own | 
risk and no distinction will be made 
between merchantmen and war- 
ships,’’ Dienst aus Deutschland, a 
commentary with close Foreign 
Office connections, said today. 

The commentary made this ob- 
servation on President Roosevelt’s 


| press conference remark yesterday 


| out,

that only American merchant ships, 
but not warships, had been forbid- 
den to enter the combat zones. The 
President's remark, Dienst aus!

As far as Germany is concerned, 
the commentary continued, the 
problem is not political but chiefly 
military. Germany, it was pointed 
made known to the world 
areas it regards as ‘‘war 
zones.’’ Whether President Roose- 
velt recognizes these zones is re- | 
garded by Berlin as immaterial, 
the commentary continued, since 
the ‘‘rules of war’’ will be applied. |

*“‘An old warning of Adolf Hitler 
that ships wanting to help England 
will be torpedoed if they come be-

was said to apply. Referring to 
previous semi-official statements 
about the role Japan would play

Admiral Bakenhus Warns on 
‘the Insidious Wiles of For-

The statue of George Washington 
in the background and the history 
of the patriotic devotion of the first 
President to the cause of independ- 
ence inspired pleas yesterday for 
the utmost aid to Britain and all 
possible preparation for the defense 


of the United States against foreign |

years ago yesterday were sponsored 


by America’s Good-Will Union. An | 


audience that jammed the conjunc- 


tion of Wall and Nassau and Broad | 


Streets and extended through Wall 
half way to William Street ap- 
plauded the speakers’ call for unity 
and sacrifice in opposing encroach- 
ment upon free countries. 

Brig. Gen. John Ross Delafield, 
U.S.A., retired, who was the prin- 
cipal speaker, saw the ambitions of 
Adolf Hitler similar to those of 
Alexander, Caesar, Augustus and

Napoleon, whose efforts to conquer 
the world could ‘‘only be stopped by 
force,’’ 

He emphasized the need ‘‘to help 
England in every way possible and 
see to it that Britain wins and her 
fleet survives’ so that ‘‘the Ger- 
mans cannot reach North or South 
America.’’ General Delafield 
stressed the importance of speed in 
production of guns, munitions, 


| planes and tanks for Britain and 


added: 

‘‘We must convoy these things to 
England to see that they get there 
safely. We must even turn over to 
England all our warships we can 
spare.’ 

Rear Admiral R. E. Bakenhus, 
U.S.N. (Retired), quoted from the 
addresses of Washington, warning 


that ‘‘a free people ought to be con- | 


stantly awake” in guarding against | that he had designated for the task 


‘the insidious wiles of foreign in- 
fluence.”’ 

Newbold Morris, president of the 
City Councfl, referring to an intro- 
duction identifying him as a de- 
scendant of a signer of the Decla- 
ration of Independence, remarked

of America’s Good-Will Union, pre-

detachments from the Army, Navy

sion in his letter to Admiral Land 
to express pleasure at the progress 
made with the shipbuilding pro-

too greatly stress the necessity for 
keeping all shipyards at work. 


He suggested, furthermore, that

The President’s letter to Ad-

April 30, 1941 

My dear Admiral: 

As part of the defense effort to 
which this country is committed 
I wish you at the earliest possible 
moment to secure the service of 
at least 2,000,000 tons of merchant 
shipping which now exists and 
plan the operation thereof in such 
a manner as will make their cargo 
space immediately effective in ac- 
complishing our objective of all 
out aid to the democracies. 

I realize fully that to get cargo

routes of travel will cause not 
only great inconvenience but the 


loss of trade and sacrifices by the | 


consuming public.. But vital war 
materials are piling up at the 
ports or delayed at the factories. 
We must supply those ships and 
at once. I am sure the owners of 
our ships will gladly cooperate in 
this essential enterprise. 

This program falls naturally in- 
to two parts. First, to arrange 
for the utilization in routes to the 
combat zone of foreign ships or 
ships which are to be transferred 
to foreign registry, and, secondly, 
to reallocate our own flag ships, 
including those which will be 
completed in the next few months, 
in such a way as to make every 
cargo directly or indirectly use- 
ful to our defense efforts and the 
winning by the democracies of 
the battle now being waged in 
the Atlantic. As I indicated to 
you, I believe that you should as- 
sign a special person who will 
give his full time to the carrying 
out of this directive. 

I have been pleased to hear of 
the progress you have made with 
the shipbuilding program but I 
cannot stress too strongly the 
urgent necessity of keeping all of 
the existing shipyards in contin- 
uous operation. Every possible 


| means should be immediately ex- 


plored to increase the number of 
employes at work, to further de- 
velop the training program and 
to speed up the building of the 
additional shipbuilding ways al- 
ready authorized. 

I know from long experience of 
the great capacity of our ship- 
builders and of the skill of the 
workers who build the ships, but 
our merchant fleet must be ex- 
panded faster than we had planned 


so that ships and more ships will 
be available to carry the food and 
munitions of war to the democ- 
racies of the world. 
Very sincerely yours, 
FRANKLIN D. RooseveE.t. 


The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, by its action today, 
side-tracked formal consideration 
of the question of convoys, or of 
the Navy’s neutrality patrol opera- 
tions, which Administration critics 
continued to insist was the same 
thing as convoying, but under an- 
other name. 

The resolutions defeated were one 
by Senator Charles W. Tobey, Re- 
publican, of New Hampshire, which 
would forbid peacetime convoy 
protection by the United States 
Navy altogether, and another by 
Senator Gerald P. Nye, Republican, 
of North Dakota, which would re- 
quire the President in time of peace 
to obtain Congressional consent be- 
fore undertaking to convoy or 
transport war materials to beliger- 
ent nations in American vessels. 

The committee line-up on both the 
Tobey and Nye resolutions was as 
follows: 

Against the Resolution, 13—George, 
Harrison (by proxy), Wagner (by 
proxy), Connally, Thomas of 
Utah, Murray, —— Green, 
Barkley, Guffey, lass, Byrnes 
and White. 

For the Resolution, 10—Van Nuys, 
Reynolds, Gillette, Clark of Mis- 
souri, Johnson of California, Cap- 
per, La Follette, Vandenberg, 
Shipstead and Nye. 

Having asserted their control on 
the first ballot, the Roosevelt fol- 
lowers went ahead to reject a mo- 
tion to report the resolutions un- 
favorably and another to hold pub- 
lic hearings on the Tobey proposal.

By ALBERT J. GORDON 
Special to THe New YorK Times. 
BUFFALO, April 30 — Stricter 
physical examination of America's 
Selective Service army to weed out 
those likely to break under the 
strain of military duty because of 
possible development of neurocircu- 
latory asthenia, commonly known 
as ‘‘soldier’s heart,’’ was urged 
here today before the 135th annual 
meeting of the Medical Society of 

the State of New York. 

The warning against induction of 
trainees Jikely to develop irritable 
hearts was sounded by Dr. Louis 
Faugeres Bishop Jr., associate visit- 
ing physician of Bellevug Hospital, 
New York City, and Dr. C. Ward

If the examination were carried

Difficulties of Tests Cited 


While it had been generally ac- 
| cepted that physicians knew how 
to estimate the physical fitness of 
individuals, experience had shown

Bishop declared. He pointed out 
that there was no clinical test 
which would measure

“‘There are numerous useful tests, | 


| but no one test fits all 
| ties,’ he said. 

“It is true 
many 
estimate cardiac circulatory func- 
tion, but partly, they are too elabo- 
| rate or they require too much ap- 
|paratus and training in their use; 
| moreover they do not furnish more 
| than objective observations. For ex- 
j}ample, the recently-advocated ad- 
renalin test for the determination 
of functional reaction, to aid us in 
| weeding out neurocirculatory con- 
| ditions, needs many more observa- 
| tions to guarantee its usefulness.”’ 
| Dr. Bishop said that out of 17,540 
| persons examined between the ages 
|} of 21 and 35, about 11 per cent had 
been rejected in New York State 
for all complaints having to do with 
the heart, blood vessels and circu- 
lation. 

“Prevention of soldier’s 
plies not only the weeding out of 
the unfit boys for the sake of them- 
selves, their comrades and the 
Army, but prevention must be ac- 
| tively pushed in building up the 
| morale of the boys in camp,’ he

Following is the transcription of 

the text of President Roosevelt’s 
laddress last night in connection 
with the defense savings campaign 
as recorded by THE NEW YORK 
TIMES: 


Secretary Morgenthau, Post- 
master General Walker, my fel- 
low-Americans everywhere: 

One thought is uppermost in 
my mind as I make grateful ac- 
knowledgment of this dual honor. 
It is that in reserving the first 
defense savings bond and the 
first defense postal savings 
stamps in the name of the Presi- 
dent, the Secretary of the Treas- 
ury and the Postmaster General 
have given emphasis to the na- 
tional character of the defense 
savings campaign. 

This character of the campaign 
is national in the best sense of 
the word, for it is going to reach 
down, we hope, to the individual 
and the family in every commu- 
nity, and on every farm, in every 
State and every possession of the 
United States. 

It is national and homey at the 
same time. For example, I am 
buying not one stamp but ten 
stamps each to go into little books 
for each of my ten grandchildren. 
And the first savings bond is 
being made out in the name of 
Mrs. Roosevelt as beneficiary. 

It is fitting that the President in 
his purchases should be a symbol, 
a sort of symbol, of the determi- 
nation of all the people to save 
and sacrifice in defense of de- 
mocracy, 

In a larger sense, this first de- 
fense bond and these first defense 
stamps, sold to the President, 
constitute tangible evidence of 








partnership, a partnership be- 
tween all of the people and their 
government, entered into to safe- 
guard and perpetuate all those 
precious freedoms which govern- 
ment guarantees. In this time of 
national peril what we all must 
realize is that the United States 
Government is you and I and all 
the other families next door all 
the way across the country and 
back again. It is one great part- 
nership. 

This evening we are giving spe- 
cial thoughts to the financial 
structure of our partnership. We 
know that we are engaged in an 
all-out effort to perpetuate democ- 
racy in the New World by help- 
ing it to be safe and by aiding em- 
battled democracy in the Old 
World and everywhere else. From 
the Atlantic to the Pacific, Amer- 
ica today, at this time of the year, 








happens to be in the full beauty 
of glorious Springtime. And we 
have eyes to see the beauty of our 
country this Spring as we never 
saw it in any Spring before in the 
memory of most of us. 

For a great many people are 
appreciating our blessings all the 
more when they realize what 
blessings so many other millions 
of people have lost this Spring 
and last Spring. So many millions 
of people hoped and prayed and 
even assumed, even took it for 
granted that fate, some kind fate, 
would let them live on as they 
had always lived. 

In the few words I am speak- 
ing to my fellow-countrymen to- 
night, I desire above all else to 
emphasize the thought that in 
just such measure as we support

genthau Jr., Secretary of the Treasury. 


our government will our govern- 
ment be strong and effective and 
safe. 

Defenses that were adequate ten 
years ago are today a broken reed. 
New machines in the air, on the 
land and on the sea have created 
a revolution in the conduct of 
offensive war and therefore of 
necessity in the conduct of defen- 
sive war. 

Nations and lands that were 
safe ten years ago by virtue of 
the mere fact of distance, the 
mere fact that miles, hundreds 
and thousands of miles away from 
possible aggression have today 
actually been overrun by mech- 
anized conquerors. And so dis- 
tance is no longer a guarantee of 
safety. 

Your government, therefore, is 
arming, factories spring up, pro- 
duction multiplies, a country-wide 
unanimous effort of planning and 
of work. 

And so at this time we add an- 
other call, a frank and clear ap- 
peal for financial support to pay 
for our arming, and to pay for 
the American existence of later 
generations. 

With jobs more plentiful and 
wages higher, slight sacrifice 
here and there, the omission of a 
few luxuries will swell the coffers 
of our Federal Treasury. The out- 
ward and visible tokens of part- 
nership through sacrifice will be 
the possession of these defense 
bonds and defense savings stamps 
which are, at the same time, a 
guarantee of our future security. 

Yes, your government js asking 
that you make this sacrifice. But 
is it a sacrifice? Is it a sacrifice 
for us to give dollars when more 
that a million of our finest young 
men have been withdrawn from 
civilian life to accept the disci-

lieve the heart. He pointed out that 
it took as much time to develop a 
rugged soldier’s heart as it did to 
build a battleship. 

He emphasized the necessity for 
the draft boards to test not only | 
the heart but the circulation of 
those who came before them for | 
military service. Such examinations, | 
he calculated, might add from three | 
to five minutes to the procedure, | 
but it would remove a large part of | 
| the potential neurocirculatory cases. 
Millions of hours of hard labor by 
Army instructors, trying to make | 
soldiers out of men who never | 
could be made into soldiers, would 
not be lost if the physical examina- 
tions were stricter, he said. 

Dr. Nathan B. Van Etten of New 





| York City, 


| lized for 


president of the Amer- 
ican Medical Association, delivered 
an address tonight on ‘‘The Doctor 
at War.’’ He said that the doctor 
of 1941 faced a difficult future, for 
if the country went to war, more 
than 40,000 doctors would be needed 
in the armed forces. He asserted 
that the time had arrived when 


|every health agency must be mobi- 


national defense, and 
warned against a let-down in med- 
ical education standards. He also 
stressed the need for continued 
medical teaching. : 
‘‘Defense against disease is as im- 
portant as defense against a for- 


‘eign military enemy,”’ he said.

Banks Get Agency Rights 


Banks of the Second Federal Re- 
| serve District, which embraces New 
| York State and parts of New Jer- 
|sey and Connecticut, were ready 
|yesterday for opening the public 
|sale today. Word from other Fed- 
eral Reserve districts indicate that 
|the majority of the banks of the 
|nation are prepared for business. 
|The banks act without profit or 
| compensation. 

The bond department of the Fed- 
|eral Reserve Bank of New York 
was making efforts to cope with 
last-minute agency applications of 
banks and the work of distributing 
bonds. It was said that $23,000,000 
maturity value of the Series E 
bonds had been distributed, with 
the indication that the sum would 
reach $25,000,000 today. 

A total of 713 main offices of 
commerciay banks, or about 70 per 
cent of 1,022 such offices in the 
New York Federal Reserve District, 
have qualified as issuing agents. In 
addition, several hundred branch 
|offices of these banks have quali- 
fied. A total of 130, or 76 per cent, 
of the 171 mutual savings banks 
| have become agents, and 58, or 17 
per cent, of the 335 savings and loan 
| associations have qualified. 

Only the Series E bonds are being 
| distributed to the agency banking 
institutions. Applications for the 
Series F and G bonds may be made 
through these agencies, although 
| actual issuance is made only by the 
Federal Reserve Bank or direct by 
the United States Treasury. Some 
of the commercial banks plan to 
carry small stocks of saving stamps 
for the convenience of customers. 


Chase Bank Adopts a Slogan 


The Chase National Bank stated | 
that its main office and all its) 
branches would participate in the 
sales of savings bonds and stamps. | 
The Chase has evolved a slogan: 
| ‘Now Dollars, Too, Can Enlist.”” | 

At its annual Spring meeting the 
executive council of the American 
| Bankers Association adopted the 
| following resolution: 
| ‘The executive council of the 
|American Bankers Association at 
this time of national emergency has 














given consideration to the princl- 
ples which determine national finan- 
cial policy. 

“It recognizes the necessity for 
marshalling the vast powers of this 
nation for the defense program. It 
recognizes the possible dangers of 
inflation and economic dislocation 
against which safeguards should be 
sought. It recognizes the challenge 
to the leadership of government, to 
the banking profession and to the 
public. 

“This council believes that an ade- 
quate national financial policy to 
meet the present situation must in- 
clude a reduction in nondefense 
spending, a substantial increase in 
taxation and the sale of government 
securities to the investing public. 

‘“‘This council especially commends 
to the country’s bankers the Treas- 
ury’s program for the sale of saving 
bonds to investors. This program 
is soundly conceived and warrants 
the whole-hearted support 
bankers and the general public.”’

pline of military life in defense 
of our country? 

No, I do not think that sacrifice 
is the word. This defense savings 
program is rather a privilege and 
an opportunity—an opportunity to 
share in the defense of all the 
things we cherish against the 
threat that is made against them. 
We must fight this threat wher- 
ever it appears; and it can be 
found at the threshold of every 
home in America. 

And so, my fellow Americans, 
I ask you to demonstrate again 
your faith in America by joining 
me in investing in the new de- 
fense savings bonds and stamps. 
I know you will help.

tive government plans to increase) 
the United States’ airplane program | 


to 80,000 planes on order were re- 


vealed to the Chamber of Commerce | 
of the United States meeting today | 


by Colonel John H. Jouett, presi- 
dent of the Aeronautical Chamber 
of Commerce of America, Inc., who 
said that ‘“‘even now, half our out- 
put, coupled with British output, 
exceeds Axis plane production, ac- 
cording to best obtainable esti- 
mates.’’ 


Colonel Jouett’s dicussion of the | 


airplane production speed-up pro- 
gram coincided with an announce- 
ment by the War Department that 
it had awarded a $43,521,300 con- 
tract for airplanes and parts to the 
Dougias Aircraft Company, Inc., 
Santa Monica, Calif., and an asser- 
tion by John D. Biggers, OPM pro- 
duction director, that ‘‘the monthly 
output of American military planes, 
intricate and difficult as tney are 
to build, must and will be doubled” 
before the end of 1941. 

Mr. Biggers, who also spoke to the 
Chamber of Commerce, offered 
these other predictions of increases 
in arms production before the year 
is over: 


“The monthly production of pow- | 


der—big as it now is—must and will 
again be trebled. 

“Rifle production must be doubled. 

“Small arms ammunition must 
and will be trebled. 

“Machine-gun production  in- 
creased five fold. 

“‘Tank production quadrupled.” 

Colonel Jouett said that 18,000 


planes would be produced by the | 


United States in 1941 and 30,000 
would be built in 1942 unless the 
present program is expanded, add- 
ing that “I am told by government 


Edward W. Szaniawski 
Times Wide World, 1941 


| Undergoing four eye operations 
jafter being rejected three times by 
|the Army because of defective vis- 
ion, Edward W. Szaniawski, 25- 
|year-old Scarsdale (N. Y.) police- 
| man, finally passed the Army’s 
| physical test and was enlisted as 
a flying cadet yesterday at 90 
| Church Street. 

Szaniawski, a 1939 graduate of 
the University of Maine, was first 
rejected in November because of a 
|} prism divergence of six degrees. 
| After an operation he appeared be- 
| fore the Air Corps examining board 
jon Feb. 13. Falling again to pass 
ithe eye test, he returned to the 
|specialist for two more operations. 
After a third failure, on April 7, 
Szaniawski underwent his fourth 
|}and final operation, which resulted 
in his enlistment yesterday. 

Lieutenant Sydney Luria, medical 
|}examiner for the flying cadet board, 





|said that the delicate operations |

|serve Board recommendations for 
more effective contro] over credit 
and the credit mechanism, repeal 
|of the President’s power to devalue 
| the dollar, and the Secretary of the 
| Treasury’s right to buy gold, reduc- 
| tion in lending activities of the gov- 
|ernment, and adoption of a tax pol- 
icy which would restrict consumer 
buying by “drawing from increased 
earnings and income.”’ 

W. C. Mullendore or Los Angeles, 
executive vice president of the 
Southern California Edison Com- 
|;pany, Ltd., was critical of the 
| Roosevelt Administration’s policy 
| under the lease-lend act, 
| “One of the greatest perils in our 
present pursuit of missions abroad 
is that we shall undertake more 
|}than we can perform, and in the 
|}exhaustion resulting from overtax- 
jing our strength, fail both in our 
|rescue mission and in the main- 
|tenance of our own republic,”’ Mr. 


|Mullendore told the chamber dele- 
gates. ‘‘A false and foolish pride 
|which prevents men and nations 


from recognizing the limit of their | 


power and resources has led to 
many tragedies. 

““‘We are now making very broad 
and generous promises of aid and 
assistance throughout the world to 
|an extent which is perilously near 
|to being foolhardy. To lead other 
peoples to rely upon aid which we 
cannot furnish is no kindness to 
|them nor credit to us. We are re- 
sponsible if we mislead others to 
their injury, and we alone can ap- 
praise accurately our ability and 
determine what is within our power 
to undertake and adequately per- 
form.” 

The chamber’s twenty-ninth an- 
nual meeting, which will end to- 
|} morrow, broke up this afternoon 
in seven conference meetings ad- 
dressed by more than a score of 
speakers, and tonight twenty-eight 
State and regional groups of dele- 
gates held separate dinners at 
|which members of Congress and 
| government officials were invited 
| guests. 


CONFESSES BOMB MURDER 


Ex-Convict Surrenders for the 
Double Slaying in Scranton 





Special to THe New Yorx TIMES. 


| LOUISA, Ky., April 30—A former 
convict’s uneasy conscience brought 
|solution today, according to Law- 
| rence County officials, to the bomb- 
ing murder of the two children of 
Dr. E. H. Rebhorn, Director of 
Public Health of Scranton, Pa., last 
Nov, 7. 

M. J. See, county attorney, an- 
nounced that Dwight O. Thorne, 32, 





} 


sources requirements under consid- |more than one degree in prism di- | formerly of Pittsburgh, walked into 


eration will bring the total of planes 
on order from the present 44,000 up 
to 80,000.’’ Of the 44,000 now on 
order, he said, 16,500 were for the 
Army, 8,500 for the Navy, 16,000 for 
the British Empire, and another 
3,600 bombers ‘‘under the so-called 
Knudsen Plan.”’ He estimated that 
3,500 American-built military planes 
had been exported to Britain in the 
twenty months since the war began. 

He disclosed that the aircraft in- 
dustry was at work on sixteen se- 


cret new models and declared that | 


“the planes we are building and 
will build equal or surpass the best 
being built, or to be built, else- 
where.”’ 

“I can say that interceptors to 
gombat night bombing, one form of 
attack which Britain has been un- 
able to repel up till now, are being 
developed in the United States,”’ 
Colonel Jouett said. 

He urged the government to util- 
ize every possible source of suitable 
subcontracting before ‘‘launching 
another time-consuming plant ex- 
pansion program,’’ and added that 
there now were 28,000 industrial 
establishments without a single de- 
fenge order. 

Pointing out that Germany and 


pts ee 

eS 
Italy control nine of the South 
|American airlines, Colonel Jouett 
|recalled ‘‘the German technique of 
| first softening up its intended vic- 
tim through economic aggression 
and fifth column activity,’’ and 


asked whether control of these | 


airlines did not bode ‘‘ill for the 
| future of the Americas, as well as 
the future of aviation in South 
America?”’ 

“Fire must be fought with fire!” 
he added. ‘“‘The Axis influence in 
South America obviously can be up- 
rooted in one way only; fire must 
be fought with fire!’’ 

Edgar V. O’Daniel of New York, 
vice president of the American 
|Cyanamid Company, called upon 
|labor to initiate action to bring 
|about suspension of the Federal 

wages-hours law so that weekly 

hours of work might be reasonably 
lengthened in order to release 

“large numbers of employes for 

more essential production and help 
greatly in mitigating serious labor 
shortages.’’ 
| To avert inflation, Mr. O’Daniel 
lalso recommended drastio reduc- 





}the office of Sheriff Proctor Pyffe 
and confessed to planting the bomb 
|which killed William Rebhorn, 19- 
| year-old student of the University 

of Scranton, and his sister, Lois, 17, 
las they stepped into the Rebhorn 
family automobile 

Thorne, in a signed confession, 
said, according to Mr. See: 
| “T haven’t been able to sleep for 
|three months. I had to get this off 
|my chest.”’ 

Thorne said the bomb was intend- 
ed for Dr. Rebhorn, who as a sur- 
geon for a large coal company often 
has given testimony on compensa- 
tion claims. Thorne confessed, Mr. 
See said, that he received $4,000 for 
the killing by ‘‘a man named Ban- 
croft’? who ‘‘wanted to get even’”’ 
because Dr. Rebhorn had ‘‘cut him 
off from getting compensation,”

DEFENSE TASK PUT. 


TO PORT AUTHORITY 


Mayor Proposes It Coordinate 
Civilian Preparations as a 
Ready-Made Agency 


FOR TRAINING OF WARDENS | 


He Suggests at Luncheon That 
Undrafted Men Be Schooled 
for Other War Work 


As the Port of New York Author- 
ity celebrated yesterday the comple- 
tion of twenty years of progress in 
improving harbor and transit facil- | 
ities in the metropolitan area, 
Mayor La Guardia suggested that 
it now undertake the task of coor-| 
dinating civilian defense prepara- 
tions in the same zone. He also| 
suggested that men exempted from | 
the draft because of dependents be | 
trained in their spare time for civil- | 
jan defense posts as air-raid war-| 
dens, traffic officers and emergency 
firefighters. 

Granting that the naval bases ac: | 


quired from Great Britain and Can-| 
ada in the destroyer deal have | 


moved the probable zone of initial‘ 
attack several hundred miles out to | 
sea, Mr. La Guardia said he never- | 
theless considered it the duty of} 
public officials to be prepared for | 
any emergency so that if the worst | 
arrived they would not be without | 
a plan. 

Mayor La Guardia was the prin-| 
cipal speaker at a luncheon given | 
jointly by the New Jersey State} 
Chamber of Commerce and the| 
Chamber of Commerce of the State | 
of New York in cooperation with | 
the Port Authority at the Hotel | 
Astor. 

The luncheon marked the close of | 
port preparedness dedication week | 
sponsored by the Authority to focus | 
attention on what has been done, 
for the improvement of port facili- | 
ties since it was organized twenty | 
years ago, and what is being planned 
for the future. 


Port Chairman Presides 


Frank C. Ferguson, chairman of | 
the Port Authority, presided at the 
luncheon. Besides Mayor La Guar- | 
dia the speakers included Walter | 
Kidde, vice president of the New| 
oma ol Chamber of Commerce; J. | 

arstow Smull, senior vice presi- 
dent of the Chamber of Commerce | 
of the State of New York; Attorney 
General John J. Bennett Jr., repre- 
senting Governor Lehman, and At-| 
torney General David T. Wilentz, 
representing Governor Charles A. 
Edison of New Jersey. 

While the other speakers dwelt 
on what had been accomplished 
through the Port Authority, created | 
jointly by the States of New York | 
and New Jersey, the Mayor turned 
his attention to the problems aris- | 
ing from the world situation. 

Among those present to hear him| 
were the Mayors of sixty munici- 
palities within the zone served by| 
the Port Authority, representatives | 
of the New York and New Jersey | 
State governments, officials of many | 
transportation companies, business | 
executives and a large sprinkling 
of high ranking Army and Navy| 
officials, including Lieut. Gen. Hugh 
A. Drum, Major “en. Irving J. 
Phillipson, Brig. Gen. Homer M. | 
Groninger, Rear Admiral Russel R. | 
Weesche and Rear Admiral Adol- 
phus Andrews.

Pilots Sent to Britain 
To Learn Air War Lesson 


Special to Toe New YorxK Truss. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Both 
the Army and Navy have sent an 
undisclosed number of younger 
pilots to Great Britain to act as 
observers in the Battle of Britain 
and learn the lessons taught by 
aerial fighting there. 

From authoritative Army sources 
came word that many pilots of 
the grades of lieutenant had been 
assigned to this study, having 
been selected on the basis of youth 
and aptitude. 

Secretary Knox said that the 
Navy was following the same pro- 
cedure and had sent ‘‘quite a 
bunch.”’ 

The observers are expected to 
act as observers only and not in- 


dulge in risks incident to combat. 
Se 





‘distance has been entirely elimi- 


nated, new methods of destruction, | 
new weapons of war have been put | 


into use. There are no longer any 
such things as rules of warfare. 
There is no such thing as defining 
the limits of a battle zone. 
civil population is in the front-line 
trenches. 
“We must 
preparations to meet any emer- 
gency. In addition to military, 
naval and air action we have im- 


| posed on us the necessity for civil- | 
It was never needed | 


ian defense. 
Of course it is all new to 
us. Fortunately we have the bene- 
fit of the costly and destructive ex- 
perience of the English cities which 
is very helpful to us at this time.”’ 


Task Is Complicated 


The task of American officials 
charged with the duty of preparing 


|for civilian defense is complicated 


and made more difficult, he con- 
tinued, by reason of the govern- 
mental system with its divisions of 
authority and the absence of dis- 
cipline and training on the part of 
large sections of the population. It 
was in this connection that he sug- 
gested the use of the Port Author- 
ity to coordinate training and 
planning. 

“The one thing I dread is con- 
fusion from overlapping of jurisdic- 
tion and duplication of effort,’’ he 
explained. ‘‘There is now in exist- 
ence enough councils and commit- 


| tees and boards and agencies deal- 
| ing with defense to cause confusion 


without the aid of an enemy. Each 
is well meaning and anxious to 
have a part in the defense pro- 
gram. The complete lack of co- 


ordination and training is the prob- 


lem. 

“It is not a problem for one mu-

identify sections of the city. 
Agency for Coordination | 


Authority,”’ he re- 
sumed, “presents a ready-made 
agency for coordination. Here is 
an agency of government which can 
be helpful in coordinating the ac- 
tivities of municipal and other gov- 
ernments within the metropolitan | 
area. I am sure at this time there 
may be some disputes as to the 
jurisdiction of governmental units, 
and I am also sure that those who 
now claim jurisdiction will be the 
first to shout ‘Who is in charge?’ 
when the emergency comes. 

“T believe that jurisdiction in 
wartime should be in the Army 
Corps Area commander at the time. 
But I believe the civil governments 
|must prepare and train for emer- 
gency conditions. Few have any 
|idea of the great numbers of men 
|and women, trained and disciplined, | 
|meeded for emergency activities.” 
Twenty thousand trained persons 
| would be needed in New York City 
| alone to pull the light switches nec- 
|essary to insure a blackout, he ex- 
plained, and thousands more are 


| rivers and harbors easily serve to|

needed for auxiliary fire-fighting 
forces and traffic control. 

“Tt is the prudent responsibility 
of every official to be prepared for 
the worst,’’ he asserted. 

Turning to the question of getting 
the necessary trained personne] for 
these emergency tasks, the Mayor 
recalled that.a nucleus was provided 
in the personnel of regular munici- 
pal agencies, the Fire Department, 
the Police Department and the San- 
itation Department. 

‘‘Also,’’ the Mayor eontinued, ‘‘we 
have very splendid young men who 
have received exemption from selec- 
service because of depend- 
ents. These covld be called upon 
for civilian defense. They could be 
trained during the time they are not 
work at their regular tasks so 
that we could have them trained 
and available if the emergency 
arose.”’ 


Traffic Control Urgent 


One of the most urgent of civil 
defense needs, he declared, is ade- 
to forestall 
panics. Civilian panic, he added, 
was used most effectively by the 
Germans in their invasion of Bel-

Coordination of effort is particu- | 
larly needed in providing for black- | 
out protection against air raids and | 


regulation of traffic within the zone | 
| under attack, Mr. La Guardia said. 
| He pointed out that an adequate 


blackout in one section might be 
nullified in effect by an incomplete 
blackout elsewhere. He also re- 
minded his audience that blackouts 
would not provide New York with 
the same measure of protection

gium to prevent contact between 
armies and is a recognized tactic of 
war. 

‘‘Every Mayor, every public offi- 
cial, must commence a campaign 
against fear,’’ he continued. ‘‘Just 
imagine what would happen in the 
area in Manhattan below City Hall 
if all those employed there should 
try to leave their skyscrapers at 
the same time and crowd into sub- 
ways. They would be piled eight 
deep in the streets. The panic and 
disorder might cause more casual- 
i than enemy fliers.’’ 

n preparing for civilian defense, 
the Mayor said, he welcomes coop- 
eration with the Port Authority and 
would like to see duties and respon- 
sibilities assigned to it and the full- 
est use made of its existing ma- 
chinery. 

One of the tasks confronting mu- 


nicipalities, he said, is the provision | 


of adequate machinery for fighting 
incendiary fires. So that materials 
would be available when needed, he 
suggested that Congress appropri- 
ate sufficient funds to place orders 
with manufacturers for this equip- 
ment at once. 


aA RS OIE TEN RNR TRE TE 


it is necessary to avoid friction 
and irritaton between governmental 
units. As a means of furthering 
this objective he suggested that the 
Federal Government drop for the 
time being its attempt to tax inter- 
est on municipal securities and the 
securities of the Port of New York 
Authority. Now, of all times, is the 


wrong moment for the Federal Gov- | 


ernmment to make such an at- 
tempt, he held. 

Both Attorney General Bennett 
and Attorney General Wilentz in 
| their speeches deplored the current 
|attempt to tax Port Authority se- 
curities. They reported that the 

fight had apparently been won for 
the present. 

During the luncheon messages 
|from President Roosevelt and Gov- 
|}ernors Lehman and Edison were 
| read. 

“It is certainly appropriate now 


to pause for a review of progress | 


made during the past two decades,”’ 


|the President said in his message. | 


“I believe it is even more impor- 
| tant that we join in a solemn dedi- 
|cation to the national defense ef- 
|fort. The Port Authority and the 


are cooperating in this observance | 
are performing a patriotic service.’’ |

NLRB Aide Hits Disney Union 


LOS ANGELES, April 30 (>»-— 
W. R. Walsh, regional director of 
the NLRB, ruled after a hearing to- 
day that the Federation of Screen 
Cartoonists employed at the Walt 
Disney studio was a company-dom- 
inated union. Mr. Walsh said that 
he would notify the NLRB in Wash- 
ington. Gunther R. Lessing, attor- 
mey and vice president of the Dis- 
ney studio, denied at the hearing 
that the company controlled 
federation and countered 
formal written statement saying 
the A. F. L.-Screen Cartoonists 
Guild, through its business agent, 
Herbert Sorrell, threatened to turn 
the Disney plant into a ‘‘dust bowl.

Union Seeking More Concessions 


The joint conference of operators 
and miners recessed until May 12, 
when it will reconvene at the Com- 
modore Hotel in New York to re- 
new negotiations for a permanent 
agreement. At the resumed ses-

The Northern operators, who had 
previously agreed to raise their 
wage scales a dollar a day, making 
payment $7 a day for day men, are 
as much interested as fhe union is 
in having the Southern operators 
agree to abolish the differential and 
pay $7 a day. 

Mr. Lewis reported ths 
two-thirds the n 
operations were being worked today 
and that nearly field 
North and South would be in pro-

Speaking at a testimonial dinner 
given for Philip Murray, who suc- STRIKE GURB BILL 
ceeded him as president of the 


C. I. O., Mr. Lewis said that if la- 
bor was not taken into the ‘‘confi-

tion and “‘given a say in its poli- 
cies’’ the government “‘cannot ex- 
pect too much cooperation.’”’ 

He was particularly critical of 
William S. Knudsen, director of the 
Office of Production Management, | 
whom he described as a ‘‘lifetime| 
labor baiter’’ and whose removal 
from office he virtually demanded. | Special to THE New YorK TIMES. 

Although he did not refer by; WASHINGTON, April 30—By a

those present was referring to him 
when he said that ‘‘others who have 
failed to open their mouths in pro- 
test should stand up like men and 
fight or resign.”’ 


Sees Loss of Confidence 


‘“‘Many persons are fearful of the 
future,’’ he said, ‘‘because they are 
losing confidence in the govern- 
ment and the government’s policies. 

“There must be a stabilization 
program launched with no selfish 
purpose, no mercenary object ex- 
cept saving our democracy. Labor 
is anxious to serve the public weal 
and the nation in its desire to se- 
cure safety and stability and pre- 
serve those who compose its ranks 
and pay the cost of its administra- 
tion 

“Our defense program is not as 
perfect as it might be, because of 
the selfish interests of some of 
those who are making the policies.” 

The result was, Mr. Lewis charged, 
that nearly 45 per cent of all de- 
fense contracts had been awarded 
to a half dozen associated financial 
interests of the country and the 
businesses whose authority .was 
“not restricted or checked by 
labor.’’ 

“Also as a result,’’ he went on, 
**30,000 plants ready to manufacture 
for the defense program have failed 
to receive defense contracts. If the 
so-called bottlenecks exist labor is 
not the bottleneck. The reverse is 
true.”’ 


Calls England the Example 


Attacking ‘‘mercenary ambitions 
and desires,’’ the former C. I. O. 
head argued that labor should 
be a part of the government, 
as in England, where its represen- 
tatives have a part in making the 
policies. 

“‘The reverse is true in this coun- 
try,’’ he said. ‘‘Labor is not repre- 


tion Bill affecting labor in defense 
industries, and the measure is ex- 
pected to come to the House floo1 
next week for two days of debate 
during which any amendments will 
be in order 

This ‘‘wide-open’’ rule resulted in 
a decision by some of the measure’s 


opponents to seek to load the bill | 


with amendments which would 
make it so objectionable that the 
House would recommit it. On the 
other hand, proponents of 
‘“‘moderate’’ form of legislation 
hope to remove controversial fea- 
tures, leaving only the proposed 
twenty-five-day mandatory cooling 
off period between the calling of a 
strike and the actual walkout as the 
bill's chief provision. 

Among the controversial provi- 
sions which some leaders aim to re- 
move is one which would impose 
penalties up to $5,000 in fines and a 
year in jail, and another which 
would require employers to dis- 
charge employes if the employers 
have reason to believe such em- 
ployes are or ever have been mem- 
bers of subversive organizations. A 


third provision would prohibit the | 


creation of any new closed shop 
| conditions in defense industries. 

|} Philip Murray, president of the 
|Congress of Industrial 
tions, today sent a letter to all 
| House members urging defeat of 
|the bill. The measure, he said, 


| sought to destroy basic rights of or- levening wear he drew the hair | 


| ganized labor, such as those of or- 
| ganization, freedom from employer 
domination and the ability ‘‘to 
strike in order not to become eco- 
nomic slaves.’’ 

He also criticized the manner in 
which the bill was ‘‘rushed through 
the House Naval Affairs Commit- 
tee in two days of hearings with 
| only two witnesses heard.’’ 

The committee today also gave 


some |

crying shame. It is not represented | President’s powers to impose priori- 
in the Office of Production Man-/ ties and to ration materials in all 
agement, nor in the National De-| situations affecting production of 
fense Commission, the War Depart-| defense materials for this country 
ment nor any other department.” | and Britain. 

Referring to the situation in the| 


soft coal fields, Mr. Lewis predicted 
that the negotiations in the South- 
ern fjelds would ‘‘really get seri- 
ous’’ next week, and that the re- 
sult would be the wiping out of 
the differential between the South- 
ern and Northern wage scales. 
Mr. Murray also indulged in 
prophecy, saying he expected both 
Eugene G. Grace, president of the 
Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and 
Tom Girdler, Republic Steel Cor- 
poration head, to sign C. I. O. con- 
tracts before the end of the year. 


Moreover, he added, the C. I. O./} 


would win exclusive bargaining 
| rights with the Ford Motor Com- 
pany.

FINED AND JAILED 


FOR IGNORING SLRB| 


Brooklyn Man First in State | 


Sentenced for Unfair Practices 


For the first time in New York 
State an employer was fined yes- 
terday and ordered imprisoned for 
six months’ for failure to comply 
with a court order of the State 
Labor Relations Board directing 
him to cease unfair labor practices 
in refusing to bargain collectively 
with his employes and requiring 
them to quit their union. 
| The sentence was meted out by 
| Supreme Court Justice Algeron I. 
Nova of Brooklyn in the case of 
John Parisi, as proprietor of the 
Linden Grill at 1008 Rockaway 
| Avenue, Brooklyn, who was held to 
| be in contempt for violating the 
| court order. Parisi did not answer 
|any of the proceedings before the 
| board or court and it was asserted 
| that neither the labor board nor the 
|union had been able to serve him 
with papers in the case. 

The court directed under Sections 
773 and 774 of the Judiciary Law 
that Parisi pay a fine of $3,028, de- 
scribed as the amount due his 
former employes under the labor 
board ruling, and that he be com- 
mitted to imprisonment for six 
months. The court added that “if 
|at any time prior to the expiration 
|}of the said six months or before 
the enforcement of the commitment 
|for imprisonment this respondent 
|}shall pay the fine, then the im- 
|prisonment direction shall be can-

‘Exotic Motif Seen in Hat Styles 


Shown by Antoine, the Coiffeur 





Forty Creations Are Exhibited at Saks Fifth 
Avenue—One, ‘Cap de Minerve,’ Inspired 
by Statue in Garden of Versailles 


By VIRGINIA POPE 


It is not new for Antoine, the 
coiffeur, to design hats—he has 
done it often in Paris for his cus- 
tomers. It was, however, a depar- 
ture for him to create an entire 
collection of hats and present them, 
as he did yesterday afternoon at 
Saks Fifth Avenue, to a group of 
style experts. 

Antoine has individual ideas about 
hats as he has about hair arrange- 
ments. He believes that the hat 
|should be made to suit the hair, or 
vice versa, and that both should 
| flatter the woman. Asa sculptor of 
hair an? hat, his experience in the 
field of art gives him a ‘‘different’’ 
approach to his métier, and he 
likes to create original hats for 
each of his customers. He’ll dash 
of. a little sketch of muslin to try 
out his project. 

Yesterday afternoon’s exhibit in- 
cluded a group of études that illus- 


trated the Antoine method. The | 


embryonic form was there, and 
there was a hint of the trimming 
i'to come. ‘‘Madonna’’ he called a 
shape like a French soldier’s kepi 
which had a veil that repeated the 
silhouette of the hat. Shape and 
veil were of white muslin and the 
ribbon was pale blue. 


His Arrangements With Hair 


As one after another the forty 
hats were paraded before the spec- 
tators Antoine’s supple

BRIDGES WITNESS 
SENTENCED 10 JAIL 


‘James O'Neil, Publicity Man, 


Gets Sixty Days for Failing 
to Answer Subpoena 


By FOSTER HAILEY 
Special to TH# NeW YORK TIMES. 


SAN FRANCISCO, April 
James O'Neil, former West Coast 
publicity director for the Congress 
lof Industrial Organizations, today 
| was sentenced to sixty days in the 
| county jail by Federal Judge Harold 
| J. Louderback on his plea of guilty 
|to ignoring a court subpoena to 
appear as a witness in the deporta- 
tion proceedings against Harry 
Bridges. 
| O'Neil did appear and did testify 
|on Monday, after he had been ar- 
rested by the United States mar- 
ishal, but Judge Louderback held 
}that he had not purged himself of 
|the contempt charge and imposed 
|the sentence. The judge allowed 
five days for an appeal but ordered 
O'Neil taken into immediate cus- 
tody. 

When O’Neil appeared on Satur- 
|day before Judge Louderback and 
| pleaded guilty without explanation 
|of his conduct, he was not repre- 
|sented by counsel. This morning 
|George J. Olehausen, a San Fran- 
|cisco attorney, appeared for him 
j}and put O’Neil on the stand to 
| testify that he was not feeling well 








|last Friday and had intended to| 
He ad-|} 
| mitted he knew the subpoena called | 


}appear in the afternoon. 


|for his appearance in the morning 
| but said he thought it would be 
all right if he waited until 2 
o'clock. 

Mr. Olehausen pleaded for a fine 
of $15, covering the costs of serv- 
ing the subpoena and the filing of 
papers, but this was refused by 
Judge Louderback, who said he felt 
the offense required more punish- 
ment. 

In passing sentence Judge Lou- 
derback said he did rot believe the 
witness ‘‘is telling the truth’’ in ad- 
vancing the explanation that the 
reason he did not appear was be- 
cause he was ill. 
| “I am of the mind,” he said, this 
man did this deliberately. He 
| placed himself in defiance of this 
court. Do you think it would be 
| too severe, sixty days in the county 
| jail?”’ 

“I do not,’’ replied William Lick- 
ing, Assistant United States Attor- 
ney. 

Judge Louderback then entered 
the sentence. 

No indication was given in the 
Federal Court proceeding, nor was 
information obtainable elsewhere, 
as to whether perjury proceedings 
might be instituted against O'Neil. 
He denied from the witness stand 
last Monday the accuracy of a 
statement he purportedly had given 
to agents of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation in which he was 
quoted as having said he had seen

| Bridges pasting stamps in a Com- 
munist party membership book and 
| that Bridges also had been a mem- 
ber of the party. 

Although none of the officials 
| concerned would comment further, 
|it was said they were content to 
| let the perjury matter stand as it 
|is, with Mr. O’Neil serving sixty 
days on the contempt of court 
charge and perjury action sus- 
pended.

‘BOYS LEAGUE OPENS 
SAFETY SHOW HERE 


500 Children Attend the First 


Session of 4-Day Exhibit 
in Second Ave. Church 


PARADE MARKS THE EVENT) 


Delegates of East Side Clubs 
March—Movies, Displays 
Stress Safety Methods 


With emphasis on every phase of 
safety for New York’s children, the 
Boys Athletic League, Inc., opened 
yesterday a four-day exposition en- 
|titled, “Safety in Recreation,’’ in 
the large auditorium of the Church 
of All Nations, 9 Second Avenue. 
The lessons of safety held the at- 
tention of 500 youngsters at the 
first session 

Nothing was left untouched to 
create interest in safety education. 
The exposition’s announced pur- 
pose is ‘‘to bring home to all, chil- 
dren, parents and recreation work- 
ers, the need for safety education,” 
| through exhibits, displays, lectures, 
puppet shows and motion pictures. 

Motion pictures, shown twice 
| daily, depict children at play in 
| recreation centers and streets, and 
stress the importance of not cross- 


jing streets against traffic lights. 
| Every evening a patrolman will 


lecture on safety rules for children. | 


|In addition to the puppet play, 


'twice daily, which deals with safe- | 


ty, a glee club sings safety songs. 

Models of recreation centers in 
Greater New York show children at 
play. Literature on safety educa- 
| tion is distributed to each child as 
| he enters the auditorium. He also 
| receives a large green safety button. 
{A safety lollypop, another gift, is 
| attached to a cardboard holder, in- 
| stead of the ordinary wooden handle. 
| It was explained by Jacob Eichel, 
chairman of the exposition, that the 
cardboard holder was a safety meas- 
ure against some one’s grabbing at 
the lollypop. 

The Boys Athletic League, which 
comprises most of the boys’ clubs 
in Greater New York, distributes 
literature naming the exact loca- 
tions of more than 120 recreation 
centers in the city. On Saturday 
the Cycle Trades of America, in co- 
operation with the New York Uni- 
versity Center on Safety, will give 
a series of tests for cycle safety for 
| children. 
| To mark the expositions’ opening, 
1500 children, representing boys’ 
lclubs on the lower East Side, 
| paraded to the church. Mr. Eichel 
| expressed the hope that New York’s 
youngsters would benefit by the ex- 
position, calling attention to the in- 
creasing number of accidents in the 
city. 

The exposition will open daily at 
3 P. M. and close at 10 P. M. It 


~ 


will terminate on Saturday night.

| Spring Brings Green Turtle Soup— 
| Oysters Gone, Candy Gains Vitamins 


At the first signs of Spring the 
chef begins to eye his cookstove 
with nonchalance. The artist who 
all Winter mounted eight-hour 
guard duty over steaming cauldrons | 
of terrapin stew no wtakes his cue 
from the sunshine and devises a 
sparkling green turtle madrilene. 
All concerned are the gainers there- 
by, as he has reduced his cooking 
time to an hour and we have a soup | 
that slides smoothly down grateful | 
throats. 

This delicate melange of toma- 
toes, celery, carrots, onions, spices, | 
gelatine and green turtle meat from 
the Caribbean made its debut last | 


year. This Spring it reappears, 
looking lovelier than ever in amber 
some of it spiked with a 
dash of sherry. Pleasant and ap-/| 
pealing for parties or for purely} 
private consumption, the madrilene 
may be set in the icebox to chill, 
then served without further ado. | 
Or, if you wish, it may be heated. 
The cost is 17 to 25 cents for the| 
thirteen-ounce can and in some 
places $1 for six. The sherry-| 
flavored type is 25 to 30 cents for 
thirteen ounces, or twenty-nine 
ounces for 40 cents. 


Candy Stuffed With Vitamins 


Now that every one is swallowing 
solemnly his daily dose of vitamins, 
it is not surprising to discover that 
some one has incorporated these 
lessential elements into a bar of | 
candy. What surprises us is that | 
|it tastes so good, That great Amer- | 
ican institution, the chocolate-cov- 
ered candy bar, lends itself most 
gracefully to this treatment. 

The label lists brown sugar, corn 
syrup, milk chocolate, condensed | 
milk, egg albumen, flavorings, fish 
liver oil concentrate (to the extent | 
of 4,500 International units of Vita- 
min A), Vitamin B-1 (300 units), 
Vitamin C (500 units), Vitamin D/| 
(850 units) and Vitamin G (500 
Sherman Bourquin units); also ribo- | 

flavin, nicotinic acid and iron. This 

startling array of ingredients may | 
be had for 10 cents in a ‘one-and-a- 
quarter-ounce bar, whose flavor 
gives not the slightest hint of its 
formidable contents.

Summer Nibbling Ideas 

We left the Wine and Food So- 
ciety'’s tasting Tuesday evening at 
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel with our 
head full of ideas for Summer 
nibbling. 

Starred at the tasting were beers, | 
ales and stouts, with the little | 
|}savories that accompany them as| 
|suggestions for the casual buffet | 
and al fresco meals. 

On view wr-s cherry tomatoes, | 
pickled in tarragon vinegar, which | 
would be a gay addition to the Sum- | 
mer board. For years favorites of | 
Philadelphia main line families for 
their salads, fish cocktails and rel- 
ish plates, they are to be obtained 
at a cost of 30 to 35 cents an eight- | 
ounce jar. Grown on a farm at By-| 
berry, Pa., they are put up and| 
; marketed by two brothers—the 
| fourth generation of a family that 
| has devoted its energies to supply- 
| ing fine tables with delicacies. The | 
| tomatoes are field grown, picked in | 
| July and August from vines to 


which they cling in grape-like clus- 
ters 


| appreciate 
|Idaho potatoes and as generous in 
| size 


| teen ouncé package. 


Our next stop was at a bow! of 
pretzel sticks, crisp additions to the 
snack bar and equally desirable 


with cocktails or beer. Plain, or 
flavored with celery or cheese, they 


may be had at 24 cents a pound tin. 


Moving down the sampling table, 
we made a long stop at the platter 
of Virginia ham, which, fed on 
peaches and peanuts while a porker, 
is smoked over apple and hickory 
wood. No newcomer this—it has 
been shipped to New York from 
Virginia for more than forty years. 

Now, however, it may be obtained 
with the leg bone removed and only 
the small plate piece remaining. The 
cost is 59 cents a pound for the 
‘“‘green’’ weight—that is to say, 
before the cooking 
which cost an added 75 and 50 cents 
respectively. As uncooked hams 
average about eleven pounds, this 


| brings the bill for a finished piece 


of meat weighing about six pounds 
to $7.75. 
After all this heartiness, it was 
pleasant to come upon a bowl of 
crisp, unadorned watercress. A 
nibble or two and we were able to 


the chips, made of 


as their origin indicates. 
These go down on the bill at $1 a 
pound and should be ordered a few 
hours in advance, as only a few are 
fried at atime. They are put up in 


| special boxes, with a drop side, so 


that the chips can slide out of their 
wax-paper covering whole and un- 
bruised, 

We liked the dill pickles that had 
been drained carefully, cut in half 
lengthwise, their center hollowed 


| slightly and filled with hickory- 


smoked cheese. The pickles may 
be bought for about 25 cents for a 


ten-ounce jar, and the cheese costs 
50 to 60 cents for a fourteen to fif- 


At the same 


table was a familiar friend in a 


|new guise—beans with pork and 


molasses, served piping hot on 
wholewheat melba toast. The beans 
are priced at about 8 cents for 
twelve ounces, and the toast 17 to 


20 cents for three and three-fourths 
ounces. 


Fish Reported Plentiful 

The Fishery Council reports for 
Friday dinners ‘‘a plentiful, cheap 
market—with a couple of disap- 
pointments,’’ the latter being the 
mysterious disappearance of shrimp 
from Southern waters and the real- 
ization that yesterday was the last 
legal day of a flourishing oyster 
season, The “‘plenty,’’ however, in- 
cludes the popular weakfish and 


| the shad, which is down to rock- 


bottom prices for fish of excellent 
quality. 

Other bargains to 
clams—now being caught in quan- 
tity by disengaged oyster men— 
crabs and crabmeat, halibut, sal- 
mon and striped bass. A few blue- 
fish are arriving belatedly from 
Florida. Colorado has sent experi- 
mental shipments of hatchery- 


grown brook trout, with the con- 
servation tags clipped to their tails.

ROOSEVELT REQUESTS 
NEW DOLLAR POWER 


He Asks Congress for Two-Year | 
Extension of His Authority 


LAUGH AT THEHEAT 


SJ” 


Special to Tas New Yoru Truss. 
WASHINGTON, April 30—Presi- | 
dent Roosevelt has asked Congress | 
to extend for two years his power 
|further to devalue the dollar and 
to operate a stabilization fund, the 


| Congressional Record revealed to- 
| day. 
In a letter to Vice President Wal- | 
lace, Mr. Roosevelt asked that these | 
powers be extended by legislation | 
to June 30, 1943, and that action be 
taken before the present authority | 
; expires this June 30. 

| “The existence and use of these 
powers,’ the President wrote, 
‘have enabled the government to 
take important steps in the field of 
international monetary and eco- 
nomic cooperation and to safeguard 
the country’s interests. 

The President added that the

History of Boston and a Long) 
Line of Personalities Are

By W. A. MACDONALD 


Special to THE NEW Yorx TIMEs, | 
BOSTON, April 30—The Boston | 
Evening Transcript went to press | 
at 8:21 o'clock this afternoon for 
the last time. The paper was 111) 
old and its last edition run/| 
31,000 copies; the total for| 
35,500. Sixteen linotype ma- 
chanes set 114 columns of news and | 
eight more of the battery of twenty- 
nine set the type for the advertis- 
ng. Five machines were dark, and 
so tonight is The Transcript. 
Every one of the 219 employes | 
turned up for work this morning, | 
including some who were on their | 
“day off.” A younger member ex- | 
pressed doubt that the composing | 
room could set enough type for the | 
first It did. The paper | 
increased from fourteen pages in 
the first edition to eighteen pages 
in the last, and then had to cancel | 
eleven columns of matter. 
With 219 men and women going | 
tonight, there was a notice on | 
city room bulletin board which |

Farewell Editorial Written 


In an editorial Richard N. John-| 
son, the publisher, said: 

“To publish during this last week | 
has required stamina of the first | 
order. The employes’ vote to do 
so was unanimous. On Monday and 
Tuesday last, employes offered to| 
donate to the company a portion of 
their wages for the next two 
weeks. The company’s note hold- 
agreed to share this load | 
equally if any promising sound al-| 
ternative to discontinuance devel- 
oped. No such alternative has been | 
forthcoming. In their judgment, | 
the response to the subscription | 
plan, though generous, is insuf-| 
ficient to warrant any hope of suc-| 
cess in any reasonable period of | 
time.,’’ 

The editorial page this afternoon | 
its ave atque vale on the fam- 
OE Page.’’ Alden B. Hoag, the 
managing editor, speaking for the 
staff in a statement addressed ‘‘to 
our editorial forefathers,’’ said: 

‘“‘Tomorrow we go our separate 
ways The particular idea and 
that made us an organic 
as the staff of The Tran- 
script will no longer remain. When 

you, one by one, shut the door of 
The Transcript behind you for the 
last time you still have left an ex- 
istence inside; we will shut the door 
on 111 years.’’

They all came to work today. 

But an institution which was as 
much Boston as the Opera House, 
S. §. Pierce, Union Club, Durgin & 
Park’s, the Old Colony Trust was 
about to pass. So said a column on 
the financial page of The Tran- 
script this afternoon. 

The last financial page was the 
last page that went down after a 
score of men had put their hands 


on the last form and had sald some- 


thing that could not be heard. 


3ut there were memories of other 
fields than finance. They included, 
of course, memories of the men 
who made The Transcript great. 
In modern times they were such 
names as O’Brien and Clement and 
Chamberlin, that of Benton, the 
city editor who was also a balloon- 
ist, and Bowker, the city editor who 
followed the circus: and Ford, the 
news editor, and H. T. Parker, the 
critic, nodding and bobbing along

and Edgett and all 
the innumerable rest.

NEW YORK ‘11iMBS, 


CHURSDAY, MAL 


OF THE TIMES 


By RALPH THOMPSON 


“ ANY people,” says James Burnham, “seem 

M to be offended by definite statements 

about what is going to happen in human history. 

It is felt to be a kind of sacrilege. They say: 

Nobody really knows what is going to happen.” 
7 ” > 

Well, who does really know? James Burnham? 
Once upon a time we used to hear from those 
who thought they knew in one respect, and con- 
sequently sat around in long white robes await- 
ing a Second Coming. More recently we used to 
hear from those who thought they knew in an- 
other respect, and consequently sat around study- 
ing Marx and awaiting the proletarian millen- 
nium. Now we hear from Mr. Burnham, who 
tells us that the proletarian millennium is def- 
initely off, and that what the world is in for, 
beyond any doubt, is a “Managerial Revolution.”* 

Maybe Mr. Burnham is right. In some details 
he probably is; his book is acute and closely 
reasoned and, once its major premise is granted, 
extraordinarily cogent and impressive. I stall at 
the major premise, and wouldn’t grant it’to some 
one who knew twice as much as Mr. Burnham 
does about sociology, politics and philosophy (he 
teaches philosophy at N. Y. U.) or argued with 
twice his patience, dignity and force. 

* 7 7 

Doubtless, some people are offended by definite 
statements about what is going to happen in 
human history. They don’t offend me in the 
slightest. They simply seem incredible; the short- 
range ones, according to their tendency, more or 
less ambitious and more or less incredible; the 
long-range ones, whatever their tendency, pre- 
cisely as incredible as their range is long, There 
are too many unknown factors involved, and far 
too many variables, It is hard enough for the 
Weather Bureau to predict tomorrow’s weather, 
and too many long white robes have been taken 
down only to be subsequently hung up. 

Mr. Burnham's definite statements range as 
far ahead as fifty years. He qualifies them here 
and there, and at points writes as though he were 
presenting merely a theory, but again he writes 
as though he were interpreting the proximate uni- 
verse and approaching the ultimate Fact. When 
he gets back to earth and talks about the present 
and the immediate future, his opinions are strik- 
ingly original and generally sharp, whether they 
turn out to be wrong or right. The difficulty is 
to untangle the observations and the prophecies, 
and to separate the commentator from the sage. 

In any case, his argument, in brief, is this: The 
world is not only facing the managerial revolu-

tion; it is already deep in it, and has been in- 
volved in it, more and more inextricably since 
the outbreak of the first World War. The New 
Deal, for example, is a local manifestation, though 
a mild and strictly limited one thus far. The 
nazism-fascism of Germany and Italy is another 
phase, somewhat more advanced toward the 
logical goal. Stalinism-Leninism in the Soviet 
Union is still a third phase and still farther ad- 
vanced—in fact, Russia has, in ‘structural as- 
pects, advanced farthest along the managerial 
road.” 

~ 


This doesn’t mean, Mr. Burnham says, that the 
United States will adopt the Russian or the Ger- 
man pattern; the managerial patterns will vary 
according to the conditions and traditions of each 
State. It means only that sooner or later each 
State must feel the full effects of the revolution, 
and that sooner or later “managers” everywhere 
will assume full control. Instead of society’s being 
dominated by a capitalist class, as it had been 
for centuries, or, as Socialists, Communists and 
Anarchists had hoped, by no class at all or by 
an amorphous popular mass, it will be dominated 
by “managers’’—by a ruling clique or élite of 
production- experts, plant superintendents, ad- 
ministrative engineers and technicians, and like- 
wise by members of commissions and bureaus rep- 
resenting the State, 

The capitalist system, now dead or in the last 
stages of decay, is not, in other words, to be re- 
placed by socialism of any variety or subvariety. 
The major means of production are to be con- 
trolled by the State, but the State, in turn, is to 
be controlled by the men who manage the major 
means of production. These new ruling cliques, 
or élites, will not represent an “owning” class in 
the sense that the capitalists were owners. They 
will, however, run matters to suit their own ends, 
and will exploit the people as they see fit. 


aa ” 


* * * 


It is not a question, Mr. Burnham continues, of 
whether this may or may not happen; it is al- 
ready happening before our very eyes. Who runs 
Russia today, he asks, and who has run it since 
shortly after the revolutions of 1917? Who runs 
Germany today, and who has run it since Hitler 
came to power, if not before? Why did Russia 
and Germany sign their non-aggression pact? 
Why is Germany winning the Second World War, 
having lost the first? Why did France drop out 
of the war in a relatively few months? Why are 
we now Slated to enter it ourselves? 

Mr. Burnham has all the answers, or so he 
thinks. I shall come back to “The Managerial 
Revolution” on Monday of next week.

MAY DAY 
It is May Day in Moscow. 





Kremlin, thousands of red banners 
flame in the pale Spring sky of Mos- 
cow, and the Red Square is a great 
open-air theatre for a spectacular cele- 
bration of the proletarian holiday. 
showmen the Soviet leaders are not 
outdone by their Nazi imitators. 
granite tomb of Lenin, where Joseph 
Stalin and his generals and commissars 
review a dawn-to-dark parade, is the 
unique central stage for a demonstra- 


tion that extends to the last village of 


the Soviet Union. Highly impressive as 
a national spectacle, in the early years 
of the regime it was also potent as a 
symbol of a revolution that had swept 
across a vast empire and aimed to con- 
quer the world. 

In recent years, however, 
pecially this year, May Day is not pri- 
marily a festival of the Communist 
revolution. It is not the Labor Day of 
the Third International. It is a day 


and es- 


of military parade, an occasion to dis- | 


play, not the solidarity of the workers 
of the world, but the armed 
Russia. In Moscow today the sky is 
filled with air squadrons in battle 
formation. The proletarian masses do 
not flourish hammers and sickles; they 
march in military uniform, accom- 
panied by tanks and artillery. The en- 
ergy, resources and man power of the 
U.S.S.R. are now devoted almost ex- 
clusively to building up a war ma- 
chine. 


Newly fortified with pacts of non- | 
aggression on both her long frontiers, | 


east and west, why does Russia put 
extraordinary emphasis this year on 
military preparedness? For whom is 
she staging this show of men in armor? 
The question is not answered by a 
decree prohibiting the transit of war 
materials across Soviet territory. This 


decree was published yesterday, but it | 
was promulgated March 18, when Ger- | 
many was preparing to invade Yugo- | 


slavia and Greece, and may therefore be 
interpreted as another sign of Stalin’s 
opposition to Hitler’s Balkan conquests. 
Or it may be aimed at preventing de- 


livery of German airplanes to Japan, or | 
at meeting British objections to the | 


shipments from the United States to 
Russia of supplies which are thought to 
feed the Nazi war industries. 

The question is not answered by Rus- 
sian reports of the landing of German 
troops in Finland. These reports are 
denied or minimized in several quar- 
ters, but their significance lies in the 
publication of news of such a move- 
ment, which has occurred before un- 


moment when German pressure is 
being exerted on Turkey and Hitler 
threatens Russia at the Dardanelles. 
Such signs of the undercover duel going 
on between the two dictators have mul- 
tiplied of late. The sudden return to 
Moscow of the Russian Ambassador to 
Berlin and the German Ambassador’s 
simultaneous return to Russia suggest 
an exchange of demands and counter- 
demands. Stalin has refused many of- 


the bribes succeeded by threats? 

In any case, we may be sure that 
the May Day parade of force is a de- 
fensive rather than an offensive ges- 
ture. Germany is far more likely to 
strike at Russia than Russia to move

OUR PLYMOUTH TOO 


In the history of the Devon port of 
Plymouth is much pride, much power 
and much conscience. With it are as- 
sociated the names of Sir John Haw- 
kins, Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir 
Francis Drake. Our own Pilgrims left 
it behind for freedom’s sake, but they 
loved it enough to christen in its honor 
a settlement far away the New 
World. 
English fleet, outgunned, outweighed, 
while the faint-hearted shook in their 
boots and the great ships of Philip of 
Spain came sailing up the Channel. 
Drake was the Queen’s vice admiral. 
Some thought him overconfident. 

Three centuries and a half have not 
diluted the breed that defended Plym- 
outh. Since last September, and more 
especially during the past week, they 
have endured a ghastlier peril than any 
known to their ancestors. Their city 
has been battered about their ears, the 
lives of many of them snuffed out. It 
is only this week that any large num- 


in 


| ber of them—the old, the children, wo- 


men, the sick—have been evacuated. 
The Nazis undoubtedly have it in 
their power to knock down more of 


| Plymouth’s walls, kill more of Plym- 


outh’s people. Not even in the thousand 


| years allotted to their system by their 


chief howling dervish in Berlin will 
they be able to understand the Plymouth 
tradition. Nor can we say we under- 
stand it here if we do not realize, in 
that the assault on England’s 
is an attack upon

beauty for generations still to come. 





THE RIGHT NOT TO HIRE 


In a decision handed down this week | 


a Supreme Court majority consisting 
of President Roosevelt's appointees 
held that the Wagner Labor Act for- 
bids discrimination because of union 
connections against men seeking work. 
The case in point involved two men 
who had previously worked for 
Phelps Dodge Corporation, but were 
not employes when a strike took place. 
Later, seeking employment, these two 
men were denied jobs. The Labor 
Board, alleging that this was due to 
unionism, directed their hiring, with 
back pay equal to that which they 
would have earned had they been in 
uninterrupted employment. 


The Supreme Court majority sup- 


ported this ruling, but a minority, con- | 


sisting of Justice Stone and Chief Jus- 
tice Hughes, dissented, holding that the 
provision of the Wagner act granting 


such affirmative action, including rein- 
statement of employes with or without 
back pay as will effectuate the policies 
of the act,” does not also authorize the 
board to order an employer to “hire 
applicants for work who have never 
been in his employ or compel him to 
give them ‘back pay’ for any period.” 
Regardless of whether or not the 


| court majority’s interpretation of the | 


law is warranted, the decision will in 


Wagner act. It is one more step in 
still further limiting the power of man- 
agement. Heretofore the Wagner act 
has put strict limitations on the right 
to discharge. In theory, it is true, the 
act merely forbids discriminatory dis- 
charges because of union activities. But 
as it is extremely difficult for third 
parties to tell which are really dis- 
criminatory discharges and which are 


| not, and as the burden of proof is in 
noted by the Soviet press, just at the | 


practice put upon the employer, his 


right to discharge has been far more | 


limited in fact than in academic 
theory. 

The latest decision of the Supreme 
Court is extremely important, because 
it now definitely puts a legal limitation 


also on management’s right to hire. An

TAMMANY TRUE TO FORM 


The majority in our City Council

onstrating what a restored Tammany 
administration would mean. First, at 
its Tuesday meeting, it killed the tiny 


telephone tax which would have kept

the housing movement alive. Second, 
it renewed its campaign against 
county reform by adopting a resolution 
asking department heads to “desist 
from instructing subordinates” to pre- 
pare and circulate referendum pe- 
titions. The joker here is, as Mrs. 
Earle, the minority leader, said, the 
implication “that the practice com- 
plained of now prevails.” It is, in short, 
a preliminary blast intended to dis- 
suade the voter from exercising his 
right to vote.

Council says thumbs down on such 
projects. This is a good measure of its 
solicitude for the welfare of the under- 
privileged, and an indication of what 
it will do and not do if it gets city- 
wide control again. 


RISING FARM PRICES 


With every passing day the stand of 
the Senate farm bloc in demanding a 
record-breaking $1,340,000,000 appro- 
priation for agriculture becomes more 
indefensible. The Senate farm leaders 
insisting upon Government 
penditures 
farm prices up to “parity.” Parity 
means the price level at which farm 
products would have the same pur- 
chasing power that they had in the 
period of 1909 to 1914. But figures just 
released by the Department of Agri- 


are 


culture show that farm prices are ris- | the judicious application of pork and

ing up of economic activity resulting 
from the defense effort is doing more 
to bring about “parity” than has been 
accomplished by artificial subsidies. 
The Agriculture Department's index 
of all farm product prices, based on 
1910 to 1914 as 100, rose 7 points be- 
tween March 15 and April 15 to 110

In The Nation 


The Treasury’s Position as to | 


Farm Benefits | 


By ARTHUR KROCK 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Often 
this Administration resembles an un- 
ruly school room, with a lenient teacher 
at the desk and the big boys throwing 
spitballs and inkwells at one another. 
In the days, which seem aeons ago, 
before Hitler invaded Poland and 
France fell and Plymouth was devas- 
tated, the disorders and quarreling in 
class did not seem so important; nor 
did the long periods before the teacher 
cracked down—when he did—nor the | 
occasions when he just let the boys 
fight it out in the school room. 

The protracted Hopkins-Ickes feud, 
and the fierce exchanges. between the 
Secretary of the Interior and the first 
Housing Administrator, Mr. Moffett, 
come to mind as examples of minor 
intra-Administration conflict. A major 
instance was when, throughout NRA, 
the government was pursuing an eco- | 
nomic policy wholly at variance with | 
that of its Department of Agriculture. | 
That collision of policies seems to have | 
occurred again, this time between the | 
Department of Agriculture and the | 
Treasury. And because of what is 
happening in the world, such a division | 
requires quick and orderly solution. 

The other day, at a press conference, 
Secretary Morgenthau struck hard at 
proposals for a war tax on tea, cocoa, 
coffee and sugar, saying he would resist | 
levies on the “poor man’s table” until | 
there was no alternative. But in trying 
to raise general food prices in the inter- 
est of farm prices, the Department of | 
Agriculture (through AAA) has already | 
successfully imposed a special sugar tax 


| and another for the benefit of beet- 


Io’? 


growers. The “poor man’s” menu con- | 
tains many other items than tea, cocoa, | 
coffee and sugar—and as welcome to 
the “poor man’s” palate—which cost | 
more under the farm aid program of 


| the Administration. 


A Direct, Broad Challenge 

But a day or two before he stood be- 
tween the poor man’s table and the | 
tax schemers, Mr. Morgenthau made 
an observation of far larger signifi- | 
cance that was a full-dress challenge 
to the Department of Agriculture. Lit- | 
tle attention was paid to it when Mr. 
Morgenthau said it because he was dis- 
cussing the Treasury $312 billion tax 
plan before the Ways and Means Com- | 
$1 billion in nondefense | 
economies which he thought should be 
the subject of committee examination. 


Nevertheless, it was quite an obser- | 
The Secretary said a Treasury | 
study strongly supports the theory that | 


vation. 


the Administration’s farm aid program | 
has benefited agriculture only to the | 
amount of the Federal subsidies from | 
the Treasury. He seems to have based | 
this conclusion on a table which shows 
no definite correlation between the 
yearly changes in the amount of farm 
subsidies and the yearly changes in the 


amount of farm cash income derived 


from sales. That was the first time a 
member of the President’s Cabinet as- 
sailed the President’s farm aid pro- 
gram. 

Explaining the contention, in The St. 
Paul Pioneer Press, Mr. A. D. Stedman, 
its Washington correspondent and the 
leading farm economist of the Wash- 





ington press gallery, wrote as follows: | 
“The claim [of every AAA chief since | 
1933] is that the Federal subsidies are 

merely the fuel to operate the program | 
and that the largest benefits to agri- | 
culture result, not from the subsidies, 
but from the conservation of soil; the | 
price protection coming from control of 


low-income farm families; the move- 
ment of unsalable surpluses into do- 
mestic consumption through the stamp 
plan, and the other operations which 
are financed by the farm appropria- 
tions.” In sum, the official contention at 
the Department of Agriculture has been 
that the Federal subsidies pay the farm- 


| ers more than they cost the govern- | 


ment, 
More Evidence Requested 

Mr. Stedman believes the Treasury 
table which shows no definite affinity 
between annual farm subsidies and 
farm cash income is not sufficient evi- 
dence on which to base the conclusion. | 
“It must be assumed,” he writes, “that 
Mr. Morgenthau has more impressive | 
reasons to substantiate his statement | 
For if he has not, he is open to serious 
criticism for ever making such a state- | 
ment at all. But his suggestion for a | 
re-examination of the entire farm pro- 
gram is timely, because it would be 
well to ascertain the degree, financially 
and otherwise, to which it fits the 
changed conditions induced by war.” 

Mr. Stedman served a term as an 
and 
therefore his observations as to the | 
soundness of Mr. Morgenthau’s conclu- 


scale of that association. But this does 
not affect the fact of a new conflict | 


the President’s Cavinet. The exchange | 





“The Treasury Department’s study,” 
said Mr. Morgenthau to the committee, 
“doesn’t seem to show that the govern- 
ment payments increased farm income 
other than ato"t the exact amount re- 
ceived from the Treasury.” 

“If that is true,” retorted Represent- | 
ative Frank Carlson, Republican of 
Kansas, “then it constitutes a most | 
serious indictment of the present farm 
program,” 

The Secretary threw up his arm in 
what was taken as a gesture of as- 
sent. Whether or not he meant the 
gesture to support the Representative’s 
stated conclusion, what he said cer- 
tainly does so,

Delays in Decisive War Aid | 


Three Main Groups Found Promoting 
Inaction Through Prejudice 


To THE Eprrok oF THE New YORK TIMEs: 
One can imagine historians of the 
twenty-first century studying, with the | 
omniscience of historians, the state of | 
this country in the Spring of 1941. Why, 
they will ask, did the richest country in | 
the world hesitate and temporize when | 
its continued existence as a free State | 
depended upon united and immediate | 


| action? 


At the risk of making the failure con- | 
temporaries usually make when taking | 
a long-time view of themselves, one | 
may suggest that there are three main 
groups who are blocking our decisive | 
action: 1, the defeatists; 2, the anti- | 
“ritish; 3, the Roosevelt-haters. 

Each of these groups has prejudices | 
which prevent them seeing that the in- 
dependence of this country is literally 
at stake. Their prejudices are, to say | 
the least, academic. Take, for example, | 
the irrelevant question of ‘“‘liking’’ or | 
‘hating’ the British. The anti-British | 
group is composed of those in whom 
hatred of England has been bred from 
the cradle, plus a small but voluble 
number who imagine chey have at some 
time been snubbed by an Englishman. 
The emotions of the anti-British group 
are so deeply engaged that they 
blind to the fact that if Britain goes | 
down they will go down also. They are 
like the Roosevelt-haters, who refuse to 
follow the President even though he is 
trying to save the country. 

It seems clear, however, that a ma- 
jority of the country now realizes, to 
extend the President’s figure, that not | 
only is our neighbor’s house on fire but 
the shingles on our own house are | 
smoking. 

The President is waiting for the coun- | 
try to indicate to him that it is ready 
to convoy ships to Britain even at the | 
risk of war. Never in our history, 
therefore, have individual Americans 
had so striking a chance to serve the | 
country. If we do not show him in 
time that we are ready to risk war to | 
get our supplies to Britain, the his- 
torians of the twenty-first century will 
have their books dictated to them and 
the discussion of America’s lost leader- 
ship will be reserved for a still later 
age. WILMARTH S§S. LEwiIs.

Time Out for Thought Urged | 


We Would Be the Aggressor, It Is 
Argued, if We Made War on Germany 


.To THE EpIToR OF THE New YORK TIMES: 


In connection with this discussion of | 


war and convoying I should like to ask 
one question. Specifically, just what 


has Germany done to the United States | 


that would justify our making war on 
Germany? 

Secretary of State Cordell Hull in his 
testimony on H. R. 1776 made the point 
that Germany had not committed any 
overt acts against us. Recently in his 


| radio report to the country following his 


return from abroad Colonel Donovan 
said that the United States had com- 


mitted at least two specific acts of war | 


against Germany by the terms of H. R. 
1776. 

Thus, if we should go to war against 
Germany we would be the aggressors. 
We would be waging an offensive war, 
and such a war is never justified. Con- 
voying would put us into the war. 
Therefore, how can we justify convoy- 
ing and our involvement in the war? 

Moving from ethical considerations to 
stark realism, what assurance do we 
have that we can win this war if we go 
into it now? 
chine efficient and well- 
be placing our 


is gigantic, 


military machine at a tremendous dis- | 


advantage offensively. On the other 
hand, if we take time to build an ade- 
quate machine and if we have to fight 
at some future date, we can then take 
advantage of our great God-given de- 
fensive advantage. 

Let’s not allow ourselves to be pushed 
into an unjustified war. Let’s not com- 
mit national

easily be defeated.

that compare for longevity with news- 
Two outstanding 
among the few are commercial banks 
and fire-insurance companies, many, 
which are still in existence, antedating 
the oldest newspaper. The New York 
Post is old at 140 years; Alexander 
Hamilton, whom The Post recognizes as

establishing the Bank of New York, | 
which boasts an age of 157 years. Other | 
old-timers are Bank of the Manhattan 
Company, 142 years, with Hamilton’s 
rival, Aaron Burr, among its founders; 
Manufacturers Trust and National City 
Bank of New York, 129 years each; 
Chemical Bank and Trust, 117 years. 
The first fire-insurance company in | 
America was founded in 1752 through | 
the efforts of Benjamin Franklin, also 
a noted journalist, whose name still ap- 
pears as founder on the cover of The 
Saturday Evening Post. This mutual | 
company was called the Philadelphia 
Contributionship for the Insurance of 
Houses From Loss by Fire, the name as 
well as the company surviving in full 
today. The Insurance Company of North 
America, oldest stock company in the 
country, founded sixteen years after |

is 149 years old. ANN C. VISSCHER.

Employment System Found Wanting |

Personnel at Washington, which is prle 
marily concerned with supplying highly 
trained men to the defense agencies. 

I would like to ask how or where 
other trained men, such as executives, 
heads of large employe organizations, 
of factory workers, of cost accountants, 
of clerical staffs who can figure accue 
rately, may register subject to call for 
employment in defense agencies. 

I know some very able men in these 


| categories who have written letters of 


application, some of them months ago, 
that remain unanswered. Are they ex- 
pected to stand on lines blocks long, 
from dawn to dark, outside plants doing 
war work, sometimes for days on end 
before reaching a clerk in a shanty at 
the entrance who usually tells them that 
all jobs are filled? 

It is a puzzle to me how the heads of 
such plants ever get competently or 
ganized under a system that actually ree 
sists access to competent personnel. 

In my business career as head of g 
large employe organization every write 
ten application for employment was 
carefully scrutinized by one of the ex 
ecutives and acknowledged without un 
due delay. This procedure was consid- 
ered of great importance, as we fully 
realized when hiring help that no sys 
tem was stronger than its weakest 
unit. T. A. Dwrer.

Hospital Rates Too Low 


City Policy on -Voluntary Institutions 
Regarded as Shortsighted 


To THE EptrTol. or THE New York Timmer 

I heartily endorse your editoria® ex 
posing the short-sighted policy of the 
city with regard to the voluntary hos 
pitals. 

A little over a year ago I was ap 
pointed ‘Federal trustee for one of the 
voluntary hospitals of this city, in a 
proceeding commenced by that institu- 
tion seeking relief from the financial 
burdens incurred by reason of its ex 
tensive charitable work. 

This hospital is one of approximately 
180 beds and is nonsectarian, as are 
most of our voluntary hospitals. During 
the course of a year it gives medical 
aid and care to an average of about 130 
patients a day, 60 per cent of whom are 
ward patients, who pay little or nothing. 
In addition, the hospital operates two 


| ambulances, which make an average of 


more than forty emergency calls a day. 
The city cases alone cared for by this 
hospital—which include surgical, medi- 
cal, pediatric, maternity and clinic 
cases—average 1,500 hospital days a 
month, or an average of approximately 
18,000 in-hospital days a year. For each 
| city case the hospital loses approxi+ 
mately $2 a day, and for a year it suf- 
| fers a loss from this source alone of 

more than $36,000. This does not take 
| into consideration, of course, the absoe 
| lutely free and other charitable cases 
| handled or the general surgical and 
| medical work rendered at free clinie 
and dispensary. 

The plan of reorganization which I 
recommended, and which was made 
possible mainly through the generous 
| gifts and other financial assistance from 
the hospital’s trustees and its many 
friends, has recently been approved by 
| the court and the creditors, and the hos- 
pital is now able to continue its work 

and the public service it renders to the 

city. 

However, there is no doubt in my 
mind that the city case work earried’ 
on by this hospital is a serious finan 
cial burden, which, unless the hospital 

| reduces it and adds more private case 
| work, will always threaten its existence. 

The records now available show that 
| during the past year the city cases have 
been on the increase. 

Voluntary hospitals are an American 
| tradition and are founded on tha system 
of public philanthropy. In a large and 
| crowded city like ours they constitute 
a most essential adjunct to the city’s 
hospital system. 

There are in this city sixty-seven vob 
untary hospitals and only twenty-six 
municipal institutions, and were it not 
for the former the city would be unable 
to meet the requirements for medical 
care of thevindigent sick. 
| Therefore, I sincerely believe that # 
| is not only a wise policy to pursue, but 
the city can make no better investment 
| than to aid in the preservation of the 

voluntary hospitals by increasing the 

rate for city patients to a figure more 
nearly representative of the actual cost. 

Even with such an increase the cost to 

the city for such cases would still be fam 

below what it costs now to care for 
patients in the city hospitals.

The Lindbergh Resignation 


To THE Epitor or Tue New YoRK TIMES: 

Your criticism of Colonel Lindbergh's 
resignation is entirely unjustified. If, 
notwithstanding the impetuous action of 
the President, the War Department 
feels that it wants his services, is 
free to reject his resignation; but I 
agree with Colonel Lindbergh that he 
had no alternative to offering it. 

Only an oracle can say whether Colonel 
Lindbergh’s opinions about the war are 
‘‘sadly mistaken.’’ Colonel Lindbergh 
believes not only that we are unpre 
pared but that our leadership is too in- 
competent to enable us to defeat the

him. 


To THE EpiTor or THs New YORK Times: 

I disagree with your editorial ‘“‘An Un 
happy Incident” wherein you state that 
President Roosevelt ‘‘spoke impetuous 
ly’’ in his references to Colonel Lind« 
bergh. I believe that the President used 
his words after great deliberation, and 
that his castigation of Lindbergh was 
fully justified ane perfectly in order. 

Lindbergh has done about everything 


| he could to thwart the expressed will of 


this country to extend aid to Britain 


| and her allies, and it was by this be- 


havior that he has made himself unac- 

ceptable as a member of the armed 

forces of this country in its present 
stand. H. J. Brownrica.

Served Three Administrations 


General Berry was Controller of | 


the city from January, 1926, to Sep- 
tember, 1933, during the adminis- 
trations of Mayor James J. Walker, 
Acting Mayor Joseph V. McKee and 
Mayor James P. O’Brfen. He re- 
tired before the end of his term at 
a pension of $12,425 and resumed 
the practice of medicine for a short 
time, but declining health kept him 
to his home at Dongan Hills, 8. I., 


until he and his family went to live | 


at Charlottesville, Va. 

A brigadier general of the New 
York National Guard, he was com- 
mander of the Guard from May, 
1923, to December, 1925, appointed 
by his friend, Governor Alfred E. 
Smith. He enlistec as a private in 
the old Seventh Regiment in 1903. 


In the World War he served with | 


distinction as a major and lieuten- 


ant colonel with the 106th Infantry | 


in France. 

Taking office with Mayor Walker, 
Controller Berry began at once to 
demund a definite policy for financ- 


ing subway construction work then 
in full swing, and repeatedly urged | 


that it be dene by long-term bonds | 


instead of the short-term bond 
policy favored by John H. Delaney, 
chairman of the Board of Trans- 
portation, which was building the 
subways. 
posed a 10-cent subway fare to put 
the subways on a self-sustaining 


basis and to help the city finan- 
cially, but he got little support ex- 
cept from civic and real estate 
groups. In the Department of Fi- 


mance he merged several bureaus | 


for tax collections into one and 


made other reforms. 
Honored by Park Association 


One of his major accomplish- 
ments was to save the city millions 
in the acquisition of park and 
school sites by getting the city to 
give up its method of acquiring the 
land through condemnation pro- 
ceedings. He favored the extension 
of the city’s parks and in 1931 re- 
ceived the scroll of the Park Asso- 
ciation. 

Within a few years after he took 
offiee the Controller, demanding 
retre..chments by the Walker ad- 
ministration and a careful planning 
of expenditures for capital improve- 
ments, was frequently compelled to 


go direct to the city’s large banks | 


with pleas for funds. The banks 
with growing frequency exacted 
promises of economies. Two spe- 
cial sessions of the Legislature had 
to be called to help the city solve 
its mounting financial 
the first in December, 1932, author- 
izing the Board of Estimate to cut 


salaries of city employes $20,000,-| 
a bitter pill for | 


C90. These cuts, 
Tammany, had to be put through 
to sutisfy the bankers. And after 
Mr. Berry had retired, his succes- 
sor, George McAneny, and Mayor 
O’Brien were compelled to sign the 
bankers’ agreement putting the city 
in a financial strait-jacket for four 
years, an agreement which had to 


be assumed by the reform adminis- 


tration of Mayor La Guardia in 
1934. 

Before taking public office Mr. 
Berry had been a physician in 
Brooklyn for many years, a special- 
ist in children’s diseases.

and one of the most influential mo- 
tion pictures of all time, Mr. Porter | 
drifted into the screen industry | 
haphazardly. He was born in 


plumber, skating 
rink exhibitionist, sign painter, cus- 
tom tailor and electrician in the| 
Navy before joining the Edison | 
Company at the age of 21. 

Motion pictures before 1900 were 
single-shot affairs—brief comedy 
moments, news-reel shots, anything 
that would interest the public for | 
Mr. Porter, influ- 





were series of isolated 
scenes, decided that a screen play 


was what the industry needed. 


Made First Story Film in ’99 


So in 1899 he produced ‘‘The Life 
of an American Fireman,”’ the first | 
story film in the history of the | 
American screen, and with it he 
introduced the radical and impor- | 


each unit of the film was dependent | 
upon all the other units. In this 
picture he also introduced the 
close-up, which Griffith was later | 
to make so popular. } 
The picture attracted little atten-| 
tion at the time and Mr. Porter 
went on to make other films, in-| 
cluding a dramatization of ‘‘Uncle 
Tom’s Cabin,” But his heart for 
years had been set on making the 
first ‘‘horse opera,’’ a Western 
film replete with romance and stir- 
ring action. The dream came true 
in 1903 with his production of ‘‘The 
Great Train Robbery,’’ and so did 
the dreams of the movie industry. 
The production was an immediate | 
success. It had action, color and | 
suspense, and the public loved it. 
By a happy circumstance, the pic- | 
ture was made just in time to be | 
displayed on a new invention, the} 
nickelodeon, and the future of both | 
was assured. For years ‘‘The Great | 





|Train Robbery’ was nickelodeon’ | 
|chief attraction 


throughout the! 
country. 
Imaginative Creation in 1906 


Mr. 


Porter’s next move was to| 
import, | 
“The Ex-Convict’’ and ‘‘The 
were protests 
against the injustices of the world. 


These were well received and 
proved that the screen could appeal 
to the intellect as well as to the} 
emotions. In 1906 he furthered the | 
fantasy of the films with his imagi- 
native creation, ‘‘The Dream of a 
Rarebit Fiend,’’ in which he used 
many trick devices. 

His reputation as the leading di- 
rector in the industry assured, Mr. 
Porter’s next several years were not 
so fruitful. Demand for films be- 
came tremendous and he turned 
them out by the hundreds. He con- 
tinued his adventure films, but 
every one else was doing the same 
thing. His pictures were no better 
and no worse than the others. 

Finally Mr. Porter quit the Edi- 
son Company and formed his own 
firm, the Rex. In 1911 he went 
into partnership with Adolph Zu- | 
kor, a former exhibitor, in the for- 
mation of Famous Players Com- 
pany, directing for the company 
the first six-reel film, ‘‘The Prison- 
er of Zenda.”’ At that time he was 
still doing just about everything ex- 
cept acting, all the camera work, 
script and direction being done by 
himself. 

With Famous Players he made 
many of the greatest pictures of 
the day, including Pauline Freder- 
ick in ‘‘Sold,’’ John Barrymore in 


“The Dictator” and Mary Pickford 


in “Tess of the Storm Country,”’ | 
The latter, budgeted at only $13,000, 
grossed more than a million dollars 
—more, in proportion to its invest- 
ment, than any film ever made. 


“Eternal City” His Last Work 
Later Mr, Porter took a company 
of players to Rome to make “The 


Eternal City.”” Released in 1915, 
this was his last picture. He re- 
tired at the age of 43, wealthy and 
satisfied to take life easily. But in- 
activity bored him and in 1917 he 
became president of the Simplex 
Projector Company, supplying most 
of the world’s theatres with his ma- | 
chines, Again he retired but after 
the crash of 1929 he returned to the 
side of the industry. 


His hobby in recent years had been 
the designing of innovations for

A graduate of Vassar, class of '20,

from Columbia, Miss Ford started} 


her career with the Girl Scouts in| 
1920 as a Scout leader, and in 1924 
became a member of the profes- 
sional staff. During the next five) 
years she served as a field adviser | 
until her appointment as executive 
director in Queens. The increase! 
of the Girl Scout membership for | 
the borough, from 931 in 1924 to 
5,980 in 1941, is largely credited to | 
her able direction. 
Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Jr.,| 
president of the Girl Scout Council | 
of Greater New York, said last 
night: ‘‘Miss Ford's death is a great 
loss to Girl Scouting in this area 
and to all of us who worked with| 
her. She was a devoted friend, af-| 
fectionately known as ‘Gay Ford,’ | 
an inspiring leader and a good ex- 
ecutive, which is reflected in the 
outstanding record of her work.” 
Miss Ford leaves a brother-in-law 
and sister, Mr. and Mrs. Lester Ab-| 
bey of Floral Park, Queens.

RELIGIOUS TIME OFF 
IN SCHOOLS SCORED 


Symposium on New State 
Law Evokes Little Backing 
and Much Criticism 


THURSDAY, MAY 1, 


EFFECT ON PUPILS FEARED | 


Emphasis on Differences in| 


Belief Held Bad—Blow to 
Church-State Ideal Seen 


Conflicting viewpoints on the suc-! 
cess of the recently enacted State | 


the | 
religious | 


law that permits children in 
public schools to attend 
classes one hour a week during reg- 
ular school periods, were presented 
yesterday at a special conference 
arranged by seven educational and 
civic organizations. 

For 
senting the Protestant and Jewish 
faiths discussed the value of relig- 
ious education and gave instances 
of how the program is conducted in 
this city. The Catholic groups were 
not represented officially, although 
one Catholic mother participated in 
the symposium and attacked the 
released time measure. 


The Sponsor Organizations 


Held at the Hotel Delmonico, 
Park Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street, 
under the auspices of the Teachers 
Guild Associates, the luncheon and 
conference was attended by 250 
delegates and guests. Cooperating 
organizations included the New 
York City Committee of the Ameri- 
can Civil Liberties Union, the City 
Affairs Committee of New York, 
the Committee for Cultural Free- 
dom, the Public Education Associa- 
tion, United Parents Associations 
and the New York Teachers Guild. 

The conference was opened by 
Mrs. Robert V. Russell, chairman 
of the committee on religion and 
the schools of the Teachers Guild 
Associates. Dr. Hugh Hartshorne 
of the Yale Divinity School and Dr. 
Adelaide T. Case of Teachers Col- 
lege, Columbia University, were co- 
chairmen. 

Most of the speakers and mem- 
bers of the audience opposed the 
religious law, saying it violated the 
long-accepted American principle 
of separation of church and state. 
Several speakers also charged that 
religious differences were accen- 
tuated because Catholic, Jewish and 
Protestant children went to sepa- 
rate centers for their religious in- 
struction. 

At present 5,600 pupils are at- 
tending religious courses, Mrs. 
Imogene M. McPherson, education- 
al director of the Greater New 
York Federation of Churches, re- 
ported yesterday. She said the 
program was proceeding smoothly 
and that expansion would be slow. 
She appealed to the audience for 
support, remarking that the pro- 
gram was still in an experimental 
stage. 


| 
| 
| 


Opposition Is Voiced 


She got little support, however, 
from those who participated in the 
symposium and in the general dis- 
cussion that followed. Kenneth 
Leslie, editor of The Protestant Di- 
gest, complained that “‘what we are 
putting in the schools is church in- 
struction, not religion.”’ 

Approving the general principle| 
of providing a religious philosophy | 
for the young, Benjamin J. Butten- | 
wieser, a member of the Interfaith 
Committee, warned that the rules 
of attendance and records might 
lead to ‘‘potentially dangerous im- 
Plications.’’ Responsibility should 
be left with the family and the 
home, rather than the church and 
state, he held. 

Expressing concern for the mino- 
rity child, Dr. V. T. Thayer, edu- 
cational director of the Ethical 
Culture Schools, said he feared 
pressures might be exercised that 
would harm the children and the 
community. Instead of developing 
the unity that is needed at present, 
Dr. Thayer held that the religious 
law would “necessarily result in 
division.”’ 

The Catholic mother was Mrs. 
Gerald F. Tyne, one of the sched- 
uled speakers, who said that while 
she wanted religion for her child, 
she did not want it through the re- 
leased time law. In talking to moth- 
ers, Mrs. Tyne said she had dis- 
covered that the law had helped 
them merely to find out the re- 
ligion of their children’s playmates. 

In reply to the many charges, 
Mrs. McPherson said: ‘‘We believe 
we are doing a job that the public 
school is not doing.”’ 


PRODUCERS END SUIT 


Withdraw Charge of Monopoly 
Against Dramatists Guild 


The Supreme Court brought 
by the League of New York Thea- 
tres to have the Dramatists Guild 
declared a monopoly in restraint of 
trade was withdrawn yesterday and 
marked ‘‘settled’’ by Justice Isidor 
Wasservogel. The suit named as de 
fendant the Authors League of 
America, parent organization of the 
Dramatists Guild, and was before 
Justice Wasservogel on a motion by 
the Authors League to dismiss the 
suit. This motion also was nent. |

sul 


drawn as a result of the settlement. 


Members of the League of New 
York Theatres, the organization of | 


Broadway producers, agreed at a/| 
meeting on April 21 that they would | 
withdraw the suit if the dramatists 
agreed by April 28 to fixe a date 
for a conferenec to reopen “‘‘all 
points of difference’’ in a new basic 
agrement between producers and 
authors, Some members of the pro- 
ducers’ organization had objected 
to the filing of the suit on the 
ground the members had not been 
consulted. 


‘LITERARY BURGLARS’ FINED 


Magistrate Curran Angered by | 
Circular Distributors 


Chief Magistrate Henry H. Cur- 
ran went back on active duty yes- 
terday in Long Island City and used 
the case of two men who were dis- 
tributing advertising circulars to 
say: 

The defendants are “‘literary bur- 
glars’’ who “push their unwanted 
paper matter under the doors, into 
mail boxes, storm doors or other 
places—a form of breaking and en- 
tering.’’ To help protect the people 
from ‘‘this nuisance’’ he fined the 
defendants $5 each and promises to 
make it more the next time.

EVERGREEN INJURY First Library for Children Only Dedicated;

Blight Due to Abnormal Winter 
and Spring Weather Kills 
Many Trees in Suburbs 


Thousands of evergreen trees and 


shrubs in the suburbs are withering 


and dying as the result of a com- 
bination of unfavorable Winter and 
Spring weather. 

The blight is traced horticul- 
turists to the ice storms and high 
winds of March, a relatively dry 
Winter, high temperatures and sub- 
normal rainfall this Spring. It was 
explained that the freezing of the 
already dry soil prevented the pen- 


by 


| etration of moisture to the roots of 


the plants during the Winter and, 
consequently, the boughs 


nourishment to withstand the whip- 
ping of the gales that followed. 
Extensive damage to rhododen- 
drons was reported from Westches- 
ter by the Westchester County 
Farm Bureau, the Westchester 


County Park Commission and indi-| 


vidual gardeners. 

Hubert Clarke, manager of the 
Sleepy Hollow Country Club at Scar- 
borough-on-Hudson, estimated that 
15 per cent of the club’s rhododen- 
drons had been killed by the 
‘‘freak’’ weather of the Winter and 
Spring. 

The rhododendron plants, lining 
a mile of the club’s driveways, are 
more than twenty feet high. They 
were imported from England fifty 
years ago by Colonel Elliott F. 
Shepperd, who developed the 
grounds now occupied by the club. 

Engineers of the New York City 
Department of Water Supply said 
the vast plantings of evergreens 
around the city’s reservoirs at Ken- 
sico and Groton appeared to be re- 
tarded, but none had died of un- 


dernourishment thus far. 


Rhododendron and other broad-| 
leaf varieties of evergreen and also! 
of the narrow leaf types, including | 


arborvitae, have suffered in Nassau 
County, according to Dr. Louis 
Pyenson, entomologist and plant 
pathologist of the State Institute of 
Applied Agriculture in Farming- 
dale. 

“It is all evidently due to the ab- 
normal weather conditions 
this Spring,’’ he said. ‘‘We 


some very windy days and other 


days were very cold or warm with | 


the result that plants lost 
moisture than they could 
from the frozen ground.

Reports from Union, Essex and 
Bergen Counties in New Jersey in- 
dicated serious damage to evergreen 
plantings, particularly to broadleaf 
plants. County agricultural agents 
expressed fears that thousands

year during the first month of their 
existence, can and will be saved in 
the future through the facilities of 
| existing medical and health agen- 
cies, Dr. Leona Baumgartner in-

fare Federation yesterday. Dr. 
| Baumgartner, acting director of the 
|Bureau of Child Hygiene of the 
|Department of Health, was the 
|principal speaker at the annual 
|meeting of the organization, in the 
auditorium of St. Mary’s Hospital, 
405 West Thirty-fourth Street. 
Infant mortality in the city has 
been reduced by constant care and 
activity, she said, from more than 
100 deaths for 1,000 live babies 
born, to less than fifty, with an 
overwhelming concentration of fa- 
talities occurring during their first 
thirty days. Pneumonia, birth in- 
jury and prematurity head the list 
of causes, all three, she added, be- 
ing susceptible to proper and suffi- 
ciently early medical 
Prematurity, the most prevalent of 
the three types, is controllable 
through current techniques that 
already have saved many lives, she 
said. 

Dr. Shirley W. Wynne, re-elected 
as president for the ensuing term, 
sketched the activities of the fed- 
eration through the twelve months 
ending Dec. 31. Through the use 
of a clearing house, he said, 2,300 
duplicate vacations for New York 
children were avoided, and that 
number received a two-week outing. 
Inquiries received numbered 8,500, 
and 555 agencies utilized the fa- 
cilities. 

Research is now being conducted, 


Dr. Wynne reported, into a method 
of canning mothers’ milk so that 


stores needed for the preservation 
of lives of many premature babies 


will be available as required. 

A deficit of $5,300 was reported 
on behalf of Newbold Morris, 
treasurer, who could not be present 
to read the financial statement.

ASKS FOR ACQUITTAL | 


Calls Them Insane and Labels 


Marders as ‘Obnoxious’ 


Irving Tell, lawyer for William

his summing up in General Sessions 
| Court yesterday that the jury insu- 
late itself against public clamor for 
|conviction of the brothers. He 
asked they be found not guilty on 
| the ground they were insane. 

The lawyer conceded that his 
clients committed the crime for 
| which they were indicted. He la- 


Jan. 14 as ‘‘obnoxious” and as “‘rep- 
| rehensible,’’ but maintained it was 
|; not the act of sane men. 

He asked the jurors to concern 
| themselves only with the defend- 
|ants’ mental condition. He main- 
tained that the acts of the Espo- 
| Sitos—‘‘these objects,” he ealled 
| them—‘‘were the acts of crazy men, 
|every one of them.” 





pleaded, ‘‘by what you have seen 
|in this courtroom.’’ This referred 
|to Anthony Esposito’s 
misconduct and _ subsequent 
straint through the use of special 
harness, and to William Esposito’s 
unchanging study of the floor. 

Pneumatic hammers in Center 
| Street drowned large portions of 
the one-hour address. 

There was a sharp odjection from 


J. 


the jurors what inference he drew 
from the State’s failure to call as a 
witness the woman of the streets 
with whom Anthony lived. 
Anthony Esposito, who was 
brought in fighting when the ses- 
sion opened, stirred only once dur- 
jing the summing up. The rest of 


heads bowed. 
Mr. Grumet will sum up this 
morning. The jury should get the 


case after the judge's charge this 
afternoon.

Mayor Reappoints Four Others 
Whose Terms on the Bench 
Will Expire Today 





A breach developed yesterday in | 


ithe solid front presented for the 
llast six days by two maritime 


of Industrial Organizations, with 
the result that the strike against | 
|three vessels of the American Ex. | 
port Lines in Jersey City is expect- | 


|released for sailing within a day. 
According to reports sent to 
Washington last night by govern- 
ment representatives in touch with 
the strike, which is considered in 
administration quarters to be one 
of the most important in years, 
the National Maritime Union, a 
militant organization of unlicensed 
|}seamen, plans to sign on its men} 
| this morning on the three vessels. | 
This action will be taken despite | 
|the fact that local leaders of the 
| Marine Engineers Beneficial Asso- | 
| ciation, a union of licensed engi- | 
|neers and also of the C. I. O., de- 
clared that they would not permit 
the ships to sail under any circum- 
stances unless the company met 
thei? terms. 
Union Opinion Differs 

The divergence of opinion in the 

two unions developed suddenly, 


strictly on the issues at stake, with 
ithe National Maritime Union tak- 
ing the position that the brother 
organization and particularly E. P. 





| 
| 
| 


| Trainer, business agent of the New | 


York local of M. E. B. A., had as- 
|sumed an unreasonable attitude in 
|the strike and was holding up the 
ships contrary to union principles. 

National Maritime Union officials 
went along with the M. E. B. A. in 
the early part of the strike, because 
it considered the action justified, 
but since last Saturday, when the 
sailing of the liner Siboney was 
| postponed indefinitely, the company 
has made what the N. M. U. con- 
sidered reasonable offers in an at- 
tempt to come to terms with the | 
engineer group. 

Officials of the union would not 
comment on its plans nor reveal its 
program for today, but it became 
known that the membership had 
condemned Mr. Trainer’s attitude 
and had voted to return to the ships 
| this morning. 

The N. M. U. 
with the American Export Line, 
and has not been on strike. The re- 
fusal of its members of pass a 





picket line, however, is considered 


legitimate union practice. 

In addition to the Siboney, the 
|M. E. B. A. picket line involved 
the freighters Excelsior and Ex- 
minster, both ready to sail to 
| India, and has also partly affected 
| the liner Exeter, which runs in the 
| Lisbon service with the Siboney. 

The parting of the ways for the 

two unions came after the steam- 
ship company had agreed to com- 
promise suggestions offered by the 
N. M. U., it was reported. 


Agreement Rejected 


After the company’s agreement 
was received on three points the 
unlicensed union presented 
| points to the M. E. B. A., but Mr. 
Trainer was said to have turned 
them down, and to have rejected 
a suggestion that he place the mat- 
ter before his own membership. 

He also declined an invitation of 
{the N. M. U. to present his side 
of the case at a membership meet- 
|ing called during the afternoon. 
Yesterday morning N. M. U. offi- 


ference in an attempt to settle the 
strike. 

Joseph Curran, 
| N. M. U., asked the Export Line for 
agreement on three points. The 


company agreed to take back the) 


engineers of the Siboney without 
| prejudice; they agreed not to object 
if the M. E. B. A. applied to the 
| National Labor Relations Board for 
an election on company ships, and 
they agreed to negotiate the war 
emergency bonus question. 

When these points were rejected 
by Mr. Trainer, the N. M. U. mem- 
bership disapproved his action, and 
| Mr. Curran was said to have ordered 


| 


his men to return to the ships this 


morning. 

It was disclosed that one reason 
for the N. M. U. 
strike was the discovery that the 
M. E. B. A. picket line was being 
maintained by ‘‘outsiders’’ who 
were being paid $7 a day for their 
work.

Who Had Beer Can Opener 

Because he felt the mandatory 
sentence of seven to fourteen years 
he had just imposed on John Klu- 
chowic, 30 years old, as a second 
offender was too severe for the of- 


fense—carrying a beer can opener 
as a burglar’s tool—Judge Owen W. 
Bohan yesterday in General Ses- 
sions suspended the term. But he 
ordered Kluchowic, who has a po- 
lice record of ten arrests, mostly 
for minor offenses, since 1933 
turned over to the Federal authori- 
ties for violation of parole from At- 
lanta Penitentiary last July on his 
conviction in New WUaven, Conn., 
in 1939, for counterfeiting. 

| A jury before Judge Bohan last 
|}March 12 had found Kluchowic 
|} guilty of carrying the beer can 
| opener for use in forcing open the 
| doors of cars parked in the midtown 
| district for the purpose of looting 
'the interiors of luggage. Kluchowic 
| was one of thirteen men arrested 
| by detectives last Christmas Eve in 
E Eighth Avenue furnished room 





in connection with a series of auto- 
mobile burglaries in which the loot 
was valued at more than $20,000.

Acts on Resignation Today 


The Twentieth Century-Fox Film

| yesterday from Joseph M. Schenck 
| submitting his resignaion as chair-

|the office of the company here. 
(Directors of the concern, it was 
jadded, will meet today to act on 
his resignation and, if accepted, 
probably select his successor. 

Schenck, a veteran movie execu-

Federal Judge Grover M. Mosco- 
witz to a prison term of three 
| years, with fines amounting to $20,- 
000, for evading income tax pay- 
|ments placed at $253,692 for 1935 
|} and 1936. At that time Judge Mos- 
|cowitz set May 12 as the time for 
|the surrender of Schenck to enter 
| prison. 

Judge Moscowitz consented to a 
j|request that Schenck and Joseph 
|H. Moskowitz be permitted to re- 
main at liberty on bail, pending 
their appeal, and to travel about 
the country provided they inform 
, United States Attorney Mathias F. 
| Correa of their whereabouts. Their 
| bail was increased from $1,500 to 
$5,000 each, and they were directed 
to post bonds covering their fines 
of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively.

RULES ON ‘BURGLAR TOOL’ | 


Court Suspends Term on Man | 


| Describing Sailors Snug Harbor 
; as ‘‘one of the richest philanthropie 
|institutions in the world,’’ the 
| Mayor said it owned more than $19,- 
| 000,000 worth of real estate in Man- 
|hattan. The institution, he said, 
sought to “‘give’’ the city a park' 
adjacent to the Sailors Snug Harbor 
Cemetery on condition that the city 
forgive arrears of taxes amounting 
to $2,169 on the property, and on 
the further condition that the prop- 
erty revert to the private owner 
when its use as a city park ended. 
The Mayor pointed out that this 
arrangement would relieve Sailors 
Snug Harbor of maintenance costs 
and taxes while it preserved the in- 


| stitution’s ownership of the land. 


The Board of Estimate voted fif- 
teen to one on Feb. 29, 1940, against 
accepting the gift under those cir- 
|cumstances. Apparently through a 
legislative error, the Board re- 
| versed its former position and last 
| April 17 voted a map change pro- 
| viding for the park layout on Staten 
‘Island. At today’s meeting it is ex- 
| pected that the resolution of April 
117 will be rescinded, leaving the 
property in private ownership. 


Mayor’s Letter to Board 


In a letter to the board the Mayor 
said: 

“I request reconsideration of 
Items 44 and 45 on the calendar of 
the meeting of your board on April 
17, 1941, in which you approved a 
|map change laying out a proposed 
| park area in the territory bounded 
by Pembroke and other avenues 
land by the Sailors Snug Harbor 
Cemetery, and in which you ap- 
proved the acceptance of a deed of 
gift from the trustees of Sailors 
Snug Harbor of the aforesaid pro- 
posed park, subject to the condition 
that if the premises cease to be 
utilized for park purposes, the 
property will revert to the grantors, 
and with the reservation of a nar- 
row easement through the proposed 
|park to provide access to the 
Sailors Snug Harbor Cemetery. 
| ‘*Y must recall to the board that 
| circumstances have changed in no 
| way since it voted, fifteen to one, 
lon Feb. 29, 1940, against the adop- 
tion of the above map change and 
the acceptance of the above nine 
acres of ground as a park. Then, 
as now, the only purpose of this 
‘gift’ to the city seems to me to be 
to avoid taxation. 

‘“‘Consider the facts. We have 
| here one of the richest philanthropio 
institutions in the world making a 
‘gift’ to the city of a piece of thick- 
|ly wooded ground, which it uses as 
a sort of park setting for its ceme- 
| tery, on the express condition that 
| the city continue to use it only as 
}a park—in other words, for prac- 
| tically the same purpose and in the 
same way in which the corporation 
itself has been using it heretofore. 

“The chief difference will be that 
for the future, the Sailors Snug 
Harbor will no longer have to con- 
tinue to pay any taxes thereon, and, 
in addition, will be relieved of its 
maintenance and care, this cost to 
be assumed by the city. Let me 
also point out that at the present 
time Sailors Snug Harbor is in ar- 
rears of taxes to the amount of 
$2,169, exclusive of interest, for the 
years 1939 through 1941, on this 
piece of property whose assessed 
valuation is $29,400. Apparently, the 
city is expected to shoulder this al- 
ready existent arrearage of taxes, 
as a further condition of this gift. 


Calls Conduct Unbecoming 


“Frankly, I want to say that I 
consider the conduct of the Sailors 
Snug Harbor most unbecoming. Its 

| balance sheet as of Dec. 31, 1940, 
| shows a surplus of $3,879,859, a sur- 
| plus made up in part of $231,002 
| realized from the sale of properties 
|} in condemnation proceedings. The 
| corporation owns more than nine- 
|teen millions of dollars of real es- 
| tate in Manhattan alone. 
| “Surely, Sailors Snug Harbor 
| does not have any shadow of con- 
| cern over its financial situation to 
| excuse it for refusing to pay a few 
|dollars of taxes on this property 
| owned by it, and then endeavoring 
|to avoid those taxes by a transfer 
of the land to the city—a transfer 
which, in addition, will saddle the 
| city with the burden of developing 
the park at a cost of perhaps $30,- 
000, and then maintaining it at a 
| cost of about $6,500 a year, in addi- 
| tion to the loss of the annual taxes 


|of about nine hundred dollars.’’

THE 


PLAY 


Extends to This Column in Simple Justice to Critics 


When an injustice has been com-, 
mitted it clears the air to come out 


and say so in public. I am refer- 
ring to the venal attitude of Rich- 
ard Maney toward critics as dis-| 
closed by Frank Sullivan yesterday 
morning in Richard Watts Jr.'s 
column in The Herald Tribune. | 
When the thundering good notices | 
of ‘‘Arsenic and Old Lace’”’ appeared | 
in the newspapers last January Mr. | 
| Sullivan, who is the great heart | 
|behind that drama, suggested to| 
| Mr. Maney, counselor of public re-| 
|lations, that ‘‘as a mark of simple | 
gratitude a 1 per centum (sic) share 
of the play be given to each New 
York critic.”’

This is the first time that a Broad- 
| way banker has suggested paying | 
| critics on a piece-work basis for | 


| their services to a successful play, | 
said script revisions would delay | although every one knows that crit- | 


the opening at the Guild Theatre| jicg have to make up out of their | 


until Sept. 15. Originally, the Carl} 


Zuckmayer-Fritz Kortner play, 
adapted from the German by Rut 
Langner, was announced to make 
its official debut here next Wednes- 
day. 

The theme of the play has to do 
“with the spiritual sterility of 
France, the confusion, venality and 
treason that preceded the debacle 
and at the end with the half-ex- 
pressed suggestion that perhaps 
another generation might do- bet- 
ter.’’ Appearing in the leading roles 
are Dudley Digges, Walter Slezak, 
Alexander Knox and Karen Morley. 

To meet its seasonal quota of six 
productions, the guild is now faced 
with the problem of supplying its

about his forthcoming projects. One

sion of John Cecil Holm’s ‘‘And 
One for the Lady,’’ now called 
“Young Man’s Fancy.” This is due 
here early in September. As yet 
there are no songs for the show. 


Meeting in the office of John J. 
Wildberg yesterday, twenty-three | 
Summer theatre impresarios decid- | 
ed to form an organization to pro- 
tect their mutual interests. Officers 
elected were Milton Stiefel, presi- 
dent; Richard Aldrich, vice presi- 
dent; William C. Miles, treasurer; 
Mr. Wildberg, secretary and coun- 
sel. In addition to the officers, the 
board of directors will include Vir-

Mrs. Walter Hartwig, John C. Wil- 
son and Guy Palmerton. Mr. Wild- 
berg said the group, which has not} 
chosen a name yet, will be incor- 
porated next week, when another 
meeting will be held on Wednesday.

gain prices, declined to identify the 
Newark house before the contracts | 
were signed. Nevertheless, he will | 
seek the permission of the Equity | 
Council next Tuesday to operate the | 
Newark house on the basis of seven | 
nights a week. Another show which | 
will tour the circuit is ‘‘Ladies in| 
Retirement,’’ which will first come | 
to the Windsor on May 20. 





Plans Disciplinary Measures 


The Actors Equity Council is con- 
sidering taking disciplinary action 
against Emile Boreo for appéaring | 
at an unauthorized benefit on 
March 25 at the British Colonial | 
Hotel in Nassau. The charges were | 
filed by the Theatre Authority, the | 
regulatory body governing benefit 
shows. The T. A. said the actor had 
been warned not to play there, but 
disregarded it. Last Tuesday Mr. | 
Boreo failed to come before the} 
Equity Council and state his posi- 
tion in the matter. He will be given | 
another opportunity to do so. 


DOWN TOWN SINGERS | 
GIVE SPRING CONCERT 


Glee Club | Offers Bach Chorale | 
and MacDowell’s ‘Cradle Song’ 


The Down Town Glee Club, di-! 
rected by Channing Lefebvre, gave 
its annual Spring concert last night 
in Carnegie Hall. As always, the 
accomplished ensemble of male 
singers was heard by a capacity au- | 
dience, which left no doubt as to its 
hearty approval of the varied offer- 
ings on the elaborate list presented. 

The program opened with a mixed 
group composed of Bach’s chorale, 
“‘Now let every tongue adore Thee,”’ 
Palmgren’s ‘‘Sing, maiden, sing,”’ 
MacDowell’s ‘‘Cradle Song’’ and 
the ‘‘Bedouin Love Song’’ by 
Foote. A group of four antiphonal | 
choruses completed the first half 
of the schedule. These consisted of | 
the ‘‘Improperia’”® and ‘‘Adoremus 
te, Christe,’’ by Palestrina, 
“Echo Song”’ of di Lasso, and in 
addition to these early examples, a/| 
‘Kyrie’ by the Russian composer, 
Lvovsky. 

After the intermission the sched- 
ule continued with Handel’s ‘‘Wher- | 
e’er You Walk,’’ Arne’s 
the Properest Day,’’ Cecil 
syth’s ‘‘The Bell Man” and ‘‘Dance 


a Cachuca’”’ from Gilbert and Sulli- |

The opera company 
singers that Mrs. 
to launch this Autumn will be 
called the New Opera Company, 
Mrs. Hull announced last night at 
a benefit concert for the enterprise 
which was attended by 500 persons 
at the Hotel Pierre 

The name was selected as a re- 
sult of a contest in which more 
than 500 were suggested and

THURSDAY, MAY 1, 


| 
| $100 prize for the winning name | 


was awarded to Miss Gerda Chris- 
tiansen Fiske, a 24-year-old singer 
of Allwood, N. J., who was the first 
of the contestants to submit the 
name which has been adopted. 
The company plans to open a six- 
week season in October at the Forty- 
fourth Street Theatre, Mrs. Hull 
said, and will present two operas 
a week. Two of the other nights of 
the week there will be performances 
by a ballet company and on the re- 
maining nights there will be op-| 
eratic productions by the nucleus 
of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera | 
which is now in this 


$3, and it is hoped that most of the 


| house will be sold out on a sub- 


scription basis. The company was 


| being formed, Mrs. Hull stated, be- 


cause of the imcreasing necessity | 
for an outlet for the hundreds of 


| young singers who are being trained 


in this country. Deems Taylor, com- | 
poser and commentator, and Jean | 
Dickenson, young American 
prano, spoke in praise of the proj- 
ect. 


The feature of the concert was| 


the first public appearance of the 


New Chorus, conducted by Herman |

First it sang Mozart's ‘‘Ave Verum 
Corpus,’’ Brahms’s ‘‘How Lovely Is

“The Mad Firerider.’’ Then it sup- 
ported Dusolina Giannini 
prayer from ‘Cavalleria Rusticana”’ 


Finally it appeared in a group of 
folk songs, with solo parts taken 


Alec McConnell. 

Miss Giannini, accompanied by 
Edwin McArthur, also appeared in 
}a solo group, and the other artist 
of the evening was Robert Gold- 
}sand, pianist, who played seven 
Chopin works.

| Music 


| Modern Museum Concert 


By HOWARD TAUBMAN 


The Museum of Modern Art, 
which seems to be eyeing the world 
of music with increasing interest, | 
began a series of what it called | 
“Coffee Concerts’’ last night. There | 
hot coffee at inter- | 
mission time, and if the warm 


weather continues, there may be 
iced coffee on succeeding Wednes- | 
day evenings. 
The programs, 


was coffee, too 


which are being | 
arranged by Louise Crane, started 
last night with ‘‘Salon Swing.’’ 
Next Wednesday night there will 
be “Four Saints in Three Acts,’’ | 





the Virgil Thomson-Gertrude Stein 
opera, in oratorio form. Later con- | 
certs will be ‘‘Review Iberica,’’ | 
‘Jubilee,’ starring a musical evan- | 
gelist; ‘‘South American Panorama” | 
and ‘‘Concert Swing.’’ Starting | 
time is at 9 P. M., and the concerts 
are pleasantly geared. 

The opening program, however, 
was no ball of fire. The evening’s 
| general title was revealing of what 
was wrong. ‘‘Salon Swing’’ Suggests 
slick and polite swing, and that is 
what last night’s performers, except 
for John Kirby and his orchestra, 
provided. The prime virtues of 
swing are its boldness, gusto and 
freshness. It reached its peak in 
honky-tonks and assorted dives. 
Although it has achieved acceptance 
in respectable circles, at its best it 
must retain that fine careless rap- 
ture. 

Mr. Kirby’s orchestra does not | 
play with the reckless abandon and 
with the improvisatory genius of 
other bands, but it knows how to 
find its groove. It offered neatly 
worked-out, yet warm, arrange- | 
ments—Haydn and Beethoven and 
Debussy and efforts by contempo- 
raries. The other performers were 
Herman Chittison, a pianist, and 
the Sophistichords, a group of five 
singers. Their performances prob- 
ably belong under the heading of | 
‘Salon Swing.’”’ 





Eastman Fete’s 3d Concert 
Special to THe New YorxK Times, 


ROCHESTER, N. Y., April 30— 
The third concert in the Eastman 
School of Music festival was given | 
tonight in Kilbourn Hall by the} 
Eastman School’s Little Symphony, 
Frederick Fennell conductor. 

This orchestra has of late been 
successful on tour as well as in| 
Rochester. Its members are first-| 
desk players in the Eastman 
School’s Senior Symphony. 


The program consisted of Ber-

By BOSLEY CROWTHER 


Here it is only May 1 and the 
corn is July-high at Loew’s Cri- 
terion, where a distinctly bucolic 
atmosphere prevails as a result of 
the arrival there yesterday of Re- 
public’s ‘Sis Hopkins.’’ Do you 
remember Sis? She is the country 
cousin who first came to town and 
adventure some forty years ago in 
an even-then hayseedy comedy by 
Carroll Fleming and Edward E. 
Kidder. Twenty-two years have 
sped since Mabel Normand first 
screen. And 
now she is back again, somewhat 


| streamlined but still very crude, in 


from | 





the person of Judy Canova, of the} 


sawmill voice and the hayrick legs. | 


Don’t expect much of Sis, nor of | 


the silly farce which bears her 
name. For the most that has been 
done to bring her up to date is to 
matriculate her at a coeducational 
college, where she meets Professor 
Jerry Colonna and Band Leader 
Bob Crosby—and that is certainly 
not very much. Miss Canova is per- 
mitted to sing a few rural rounde- 
lays and one operatic aria which 
fits into the picture about as sensi- 
Mr. Colonna, 
as usual, pops his eyes and makes 
inane remarks. Charles Butter- 
worth acts bewildered as_ the 
wealthy uncle of Sis, and Mr. 
Crosby just looks very vapid and 
waves his arms at his band. 
Through it all blows the flavor of 
ripening corn. This one should 
reach maturity in the hinterland 
about midsummer, but right now, 
here in the city, it looks exceed- 
ingly green.

Walker Reaches Vander Meer,

—Cards 4 Points Ahead 


By ROSCOE McGOWEN 


Baseball history repeated itself at 
Ebbets Field yesterday and the 21,- 
148 Flatbush fans who sat in on the 
recording still were a little dazed as 
they wended their several ways 
homeward. 

For the pennant-conscious Dodg- | 

rs came from behind in the eighth | 
ings topple the} 
world champion Reds for the third 
straight y, this time by 4 to 3, t 
match the Brooklyn winning streak 
of nine straight last year. 

Dixie Walker and Muscles 
wick hit home runs, the lat 
off Johnny (Double-No-Hit) 
Vander Meer to tie the score in the 
eighth, and a pair of two-baggers 

y Mickey Owen and Peewee Reese 

.ched the game in the ninth.

is a touch of irony in the 
Brooklyn feat of not only taking 
nine straight, but winning thirteen 
of their last fourteen games this | 
BE The swiftly moving Car-/| 
dinals, by beating the Giants again, 
moved into undisputed possession of 
first place through a vagary of 
mathematics by a margin of four 
percentage points. They had been 
tied with the Dodgers. 
Until the devastating 
eighth it looked like an easy tri- 
comiehe for Vander Meer and the 
Reds. Vandy had permitted only 
our singles, one a scratch infield 
, had struck out eight and only 
e Dodger had perched briefly on 
hird base. 
The Reds had started early, with 
he pestiferous Lonnie Frey open- 
ing the scoring. Lonnie drew 
of the six passes he has been pre- 
sented with in the three games in 
first frame and scored the first 
run on a long fly. 


Reaches Third on Double 


Kirby Higbe then 
hold the Reds until the sixth, 
Frank McCormick walloped his 
fifth homer of the season and his 
hird in the three games. Bill Wer- 
ber followed with a single and, with 
two away, reached third on Mike 
McCormick’s double. 

Then, while Higbe was taking a 
long stretch to pitch to Vander 
Meer, the Reds pulled a ‘double 
steal, Werber sliding home easily 
with the third run. 

In the Brooklyn eighth Rees¢ 

ounded to Werber, but Walker 
hold of one and bounced the 
1 against the screen above the 
yreboard, the pellet falling behind 
for Dixie’s third homer of the year.

Keltner’s 400-Foot Homer With One On Ends 
' Game—Weatherly and Heath Connect, 


While McCoy Wastes 4- Bagger 


é 


By The Associated Press. 
CLEVELAND, April 30—The 
walking out because 
league-leading Indians were 
runs behind, had nobody on 
and two were out in the ninth. 
the Athletics never got that 
man and the Tribe won, 6 to 5. 

Ken Keltner’s 400-foot home run 
wooden bleach- 
ers at League Park broke up the 
game and defeated Lester McCrabb, 
rookie pitcher, after he had been 
ahead all the way. 

Philadelphia had a 5-to-3 lead and 
the first two Indians in the ninth 
went out so tamely that every one 
was certain they didn’t have a 
chance. But, thanks partly to 
earlier homers by Roy Weatherly 
and Jeff Heath, the game was sal-| 
vaged into their sixth straight tri-| 
umph. } 

Bulky Murray Howell, 1940 Inter- | 
national League batting champion | 
now doing pinch-hitting stints for | 
Cleveland, slowly plodded 
plate and drew McCrabb’s ony} 
pass, Oscar Grimes ran _ for} 
Howell and scored when Weatherly 
promptly smacked a double agajnst | 
screen in right center, Roy’s 
third straight hit. Then Keltner, 
who hadn't driven a ball out of the 
infield four previous attempts, 
hit the longest circuit blow in 
League Park this year to win.

CUBS’ HEAVY ATTACK 
SUBDUES BRAVES, 9-4 


Seclitibiaies Party Is Spoiled 
| as Three Boston Harlers Fail 


BOSTON, April 30 (-P)—The Cubs, 
who had dropped six of their 
previous starts, ruined the Braves’ 
| rechristening party today by belting 
| three of their pitchers for a 9-4 tri- 
umph. 

Although the temperature, due to 
a sudden shift of the wind, dropped 
33 degrees in 12 minutes just before 
game time, the Cubs opened in 
heated fashion and clinched the 
contest by driving Manny Salvo 
from the box in the first 
They scored four 
and three passes and

| Boston’s third hurler, was pounded 
| for four more runs in the eighth.

run in the eighth, he

A Game of Paradoxes 


This really was a game of para-

and went the distance. Nahem, 
however, gave only five hits for 
eight innings and when he yielded 
his sixth safety to open the ninth, 
he was unceremoniously derricked.

fray. A fluke double by Billy 
Jurges and a single by Schumie had 
given them one run in the fifth 
and in the eighth a pair of walks 
and a homer by Babe Young 
brought in three more.

For Schumie had tripped over his

and Slaughter caromed one off the

for his circuit blow in the ninth. 

The Young homer had lifted the 
Giants into a challenging position. 
But when Joe Orengo doubled to 
open the ninth and Jurges received 
a base on balls, the Terrymen’s 
rally fizzled. Frank Demaree, bat- 
ting for Schumie, fouled out and 
Johnny Rucker slapped into a 
double play to insure Nahem his 
second victory of the campaign. 
This was Schumacher's first set-

Sparkling Infield Play Keeps | 
St. Louis Club in Check— | 
Rizzuto in Spotlight 


By JAMES P. DAWSON 
Special to THE New York Times. 

ST. LOUIS, April 30—The Yankees 
went on a rampage today at Sports- 
man’s Park and put the lowly} 
Browns right back in their place. | 
Irked no end by their defeat yes- 
terday, Joe McCarthy’s clubbers 
smacked Johnny Niggeling for four- 
teen blows and, im the gloom of a 
cloudy afternoon, won from the St. 
Louis club by 7 to 1 

Joe Gordon led the Yankee firing. 
He and George Selkirk hit homers. 
In addition, Gordon smacked three 
solid singles, hammering in four 
of the runs that brought the Yanks | 
their first victory in the West and 
gave Marius Russo his third tri- 
umph despite a spotty pitching per- 
formance. 

Russo discovered that Yankee 
hitting at times covers a multitude 
of sins. The Long Island southpaw | 
was not impressive. He issued six | 
passes and was clubbed for eight | 
blows, three of them for extra | 
bases. He gave up four passes in 
the first two innings and four hits 
in the first three. 


Seven Brownies Stranded 


But the impregnable work of the 
infield was reflected in the fact 
that seven runners were stranded 
in the first three frames, the first 
of two Yankee double plays turning 
the Browns back with loaded bases 
in the first. 

The Yanks, on the other hand, 
lost no time going to work on Nig- 
geling. Phil Rizzuto singled, Red 
Rolfe scratched a hit, Selkirk sac- 
rificed, Joe DiMaggio was inten- 
ffonally passed and Gordon made 
a single that gave the Yanks two 
in the first 

Selkirk’s homer disappeared over 
the right-field roof in the third. In 
the fifth a pass to Selkirk, Don 
Heffner’s error on Charley Keller’s 
slap, and Gordon’s long fly fash- 
ijoned the fourth Yankee run. 

Successive singles by Keller, Gor- | 
don and Bill Dickey filled the bases | 
in the seventh with two out, and 
Niggeling forced one in with a pass 
to Jerry Priddy. In the eighth 
Rizzuto beat out a bunt, advanced | 
on a passed ball and raced home 
on DiMaggio’s single. 

Gordon exploded his fourth homer 
of the campaign to open the ninth. 
The ball bounced off the left-field | 
scoreboard back on to the field. 

The Browns broke through in the 
seventh when Harlond Clift tripled 
and Roberto Estalella singled. 


Rain Causes Short Delay 


Cloudy skies let forth a shower 
at game time, but play got under | 
way after only a short delay. 


President Ed Barrow wired from 
the home office in New York that 
Bump Hadley, returned by the 
Giants, had been sent to the Ath- 
letics in an outright sale. 


In addition to figuring in two 
double plays that were of inesti-| 
mable value to Mr. Russo and con-| 
tributing two hits to the Yankee 
barrage, Scooter Rizzuto was all 
over the place, pulling down pop 
flies in center and left.

Something About Shortstops 


ed to the chatter about shortstops. There 
are some good ones around. The esteemed Casey 
Stengel might be pardoned for barking that he 
has the best with the Braves, the same being Ed 
ward Robert Miller, 5 feet 9, 165 and 
owner of “a great pair of hands.” 

Any shortstop who doesn’t have “a great pair 
of hands” isn’t worth mentioning. But the 
dict on Eddie Miller is unanimous—in Boston. 
In Brooklyn there’s a different story. The Flat- 
bush fans think they have two better shortstops 
than Eddie Miller of Boston, Mass. One is Lippy 
Leo Durocher, who doesn’t bother to play, and 
Peewee Reese, who does bother. He bothers the 
teams that have to play the Dodgers on any given 
afternoon. The Polo Grounds rooters swear by 
Sure-Shot Bill Jurges who, they insist, is the 
slickest gent playing shortstop these stirring 
days. 

Out in Cleveland the cheering is for Lou Bou- 
dreau. And not without reason. Yankee Stadi- 
um fans sold themselves in a hurry on Scooter 
Rizzuto, the kid from Kansas City. He can go 
to his right and kill off his men with a rifle peg 
to first base. There’s a fellow named Frankie 
Crosetti with the Yankees who wouldn’t go to 
waste if the Yankees unchained him from their 
bench. He can play shortstop in smooth style. 


jee rise of Rizzuto with the Yankees has add- 


pounds 


ver- 


Going to Bat 


These are fine young fellows and it’s a treat to 
watch them mop up a grounder and waft the ball 
across the diamond for the kill, But there are a 
couple of old codgers around who must smile a 
bit when they have to listen to all the chatter 
about the bright youngsters. The reference is to 
Arky Vaughan of the Pirates and Luke Appling 
of the White Sox. 

There’s a gaffer named Joe Cronin, too. 
this interested bystander wouldn’t try to per- 
suade anybody that J. Edward Cronin is as spry 
around shortstop as he was five years ago. Or as 
sure of coming up with the ball when he makes 
a grab for it. But which one of these rising stars 
at shortstop can carry Cronin’s bat? That part 
of it counts in the long run, too. 

Furthermore, while poring over the records, 
this observer found something curious. Total 
chances in a season are a pretty good indication 
of how much ground a shortstop covers and the 
ancient J. Edward Cronin was just a mere hand- 
ful of chances behind Leaping Lou Boudreau, the 
American League leader, in that department last 
season. If he can’t jump as far as Boudreau, 
maybe he knows a little more about where to 
stand and wait for ’em. 


The Test of Time 


It will take some time to decide how the honors 
are to be divided among Peewee Reese, Eddie 
Miller, Scooter Rizzuto and Lou Boudreau. Just 
now it’s a matter of local option. There may be 
added starters in that race, too. They come up 
fast. Witness Rizzuto. 

But there are two shortstops who have passed 
the test of time and are still doing quite a busi- 
ness at the old stand. This is Arky Vaughan’s 
tenth season as a regular in the Pittsburgh in- 


Now,

field and it’s Luke Appling’s eleventh season as 
a fixture in the White Sox infield. Arky is no 
master of finesse around shortstop but he gets 
around, 

Eddie Miller led the National League shortstops 
n total chances last season but Arky Vaughan 
was next in line and not far away. And Luke 
Appling was well up in the American League. 

Having men like that to play shortstop is like 
having a Lou Gehrig to cover first base. It 
means one position about which the manager has

hand. 


Standing in the Shade 

Joe DiMaggio is a pretty good hitter, isn’t he? 
Well, Joe of the DiMaggio clan led the American 
League in batting last season with a mark of 
.352. The next man was not a heavy-hitting out- 
fielder or a slugging first baseman. He was a 
shortstop, Luke Appling. Luke hit a trifling 
.348 for the season. In the last eight seasons 
Luke has averaged about .320 and yet the cheers 
for him have been something less than deafening. 
Luke always seems to be standing in the shade, 
Nobody pays much attention to him. He has no 
leader. Nobody gets up Luke Appling 
Marching and Rooting Clubs. Maybe only the 
American League pitchers—and the National 
League pitchers in all-star games—know what a 
valuable ball player Luke is and has been for 
years. 

Arky Vaughan is in a somewhat similar posi- 
tion but he has received a little more attention 
than Appling, an odd cheer from enemy fans now 
and then. And also the same deep respect from 
enemy pitchers. Arky has been pounding away 
for an average of about .325 since he went up 
there with his open-face stance to whack away 
at National League pitchers. 

Think of having shortstops like that! Out- 
fielders or first basemen with such averages over 
a respectable span of years would be cherished by 
the best of managers. But shortstops! That’s 
almost too good to be true. 


Hitting to Right 


Aside from that, maybe some manager, coach, 
player, scout or bleacherite will come up with an 
explanation for an odd situation around shortstop. 
Why is it that, compared to the American League, 
so Many More grounders go in that direction in 
the National League? It’s a matter of record. 

Last year, for instance, Eddie Miller topped the 
National League in total chances with 920 in 151 
games. Arky Vaughan was next with 906 in 155 
games. Over in the American League Lou Bou- 
dreau was the leader with 755 total chances in 
155 games, followed by Joe Cronin with 733 in 
146 games and Luke Appling with 730 in 150 
games. There’s a wide gap in the totals between 
the two leagues. Can it be that the American 
League hitters stick more closely to the old bat- 
ting slogan of “Take two and hit to right’?

WOOD, FIELD 


AND STREAM 


By BAYMOND BR. CAMP 


Day by day the ice is leaving the 
Northern New England lakes, and 
the next few days should see every 
important trout and salmon water 
in Maine, New Hampshire and Ver- 
mont producing some good catches. 

The ice finally left Kennebago, 
and a wire from Lewis York, who 
has a camp on this famous water, 
informs us that conditions are per- 
fect for early fishing. Moosehead 
Lake is about two-thirds clear and 
the Maine Development Commission 


| wired us that some excellent catch- 
|es should be made on this body of 


water today. 
Madawamkeag Free of Ice 


Rangely, Mooselucmeguntic, Grand 
Lake Stream, all of the Jackman 


area and several smaller Northern | 


lakes are now open. Madawamkeag, 
a favorite with many anglers, 


also free of ice, according to Dick | 


Reed, who has been checking the 
conditions of many lakes and 
streams. 


Unless the Governor of Vermont | 
|is forced 


to close the streams to 
fishing because of the fire hazard, 
the season there will get 
way this morning. The streams 


and 
ice.

The fire 


are now free 

hazard is still 
and it is feared 
|that it may be necessary to pro- 
hibit fishing unless a heavy rain- 
occurs within the next few 
days. 


Conditions at the Averill Lakes 


in Northeastern Vermont are ex- | 
| cellent, 
Rudko and| Quimby’s Camps, 


according to a letter from 
with 
salmon plentiful 
George Donovan at Echo 
reports unusually good 
| conditions. 

Checking with the 
and Game Commission at 
| Hartford yesterday, we learned that 
temporary emergéncy closing 
of the trout season is still in ef- 


fect and will be until a heavy rain- | 


fall eliminates the fire hazard. 
It is unfortunate that such a sit- 


uation should prevent anglers from | 
enjoying the finest early fishing in

Fish Traps Crowded 

Charley Ferrara, the tireless surf- 
caster of Seaside Heights, N. J., 
reports that conditions from the| 
Manasquan to Barnegat Inlet are | 
| tar from rosy as yet, but that the 
prospects are good for the early 
fishing. 
| seem to be crowded with kingfish, 


| which he considers to be an excel-| 


|lent omen for the season. 
Incidentally, those who have want- 
ed to take up surfcasting but have 
been unable to find any one to show 
them the ropes, 
opportunity to learn from an ex- 
pert, for Charley is now enrolling 
|students in a surfcasting school. 
|The course will include six lessons 
and will cover the fundamentals of 


| lore. 


Classes will be 


sloughway. As we understand it, 
there will be a $10 tuition fee, and 


|already a number of students have 


been enrolled. 

Although the idea may have arisen 
as a result of Professor John Alden 
Knight's Chair of Angling at Colum- 
bia University, the plan is a good 


| one and should prove popular.

Incidentally, having mentioned 
Professor Knight, we are reminded 
of the ‘‘roses of yesterday.”’ Since 
he has been living in the wilds of 


Pennsylvania, it is impossible to stir | 


him into an argument. Even praise 


of Mark Burlingame’s new stream- | 


er, the Flexible Fancy, fails to get 
a rise, and the Angler's Club knows

for Derby on Saturday 


DISPOSE TIMED IN 2:06 3/5 


But Staretor Works Mile and 
Quarter in Slow 2:12—Blue 
Pair’s Injury Confirmed 


By The Associated Press. 

LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 30—The 
field for Saturday's sixty-seventh 
running of the Kentucky Derby 
shrank to eleven probable starters 
today while holiday bunting and 
pennants broke out on all main 
thoroughfares. Hotel lobbies were 
jammed and food and drink prices 
began their yearly climb as the van- 
guard of an expected crowd of 100,-| 
000 poured into the city. 

Developments of an otherwise 
quiet day were the disclosure by 
Trainer George Brooks that he 
would not send the long shot, 
Agricole, to the post, and a work- 
out by Robert J. Kleberg Jr.'s Dis- 
pose which took some of the re- 
cently-acquired tarnish off the repu- 
tation of that Texas-owned colt.

LAMBERT SIMNEL SCORES 





Florida, Dispose ran a miserable 
last in the Experimental Handicap 
at Jamaica on April 19, without/| 
once showing a lick of speed. Im- 
mediately he dropped from among | 
the ranking contenders to just | 
another package of horseflesh that 
would chase the Derby winner 
home. 

But this morning, less than 
twenty-four hours after he stepped | 
out of the railroad car which 
brought him from New York, he| 
went the full mile-and-a-quarter | 
route at Churchill Downs in 2:06 3-5, | 
one of the better preps among the | 
candidates for the $75,000 added | 
jackpot. Immediately the railbirds 
put him back in the picture. 


Mile Turned in 1:39 


All the way it was a surprising 
workout by the son of Discovery. 
He showed little sign of tiring as| 
he stepped the six furlongs in 
1:13 2-5, the mile in 1:39 and the 
mile and an eighth in 1:53 on‘ the 
Way. 

At the same time another prob- 
able starter, although one of the! 
two or three rank outsiders in the 
field, just about eliminated himself 
es a possible surprise package. 
This was Staretor, owned by Hugh 
Nesbitt of California. He was sent 
over the full route by his Derby 
jockey, Georgie Woolf, and, after 
stepping a snappy 0:483-5 half- 
mile, he ran wide and was clocked 
in 2:12. 

J. Fred Byers’s Robert Morris 
and Louis Tufano’s Market Wise, 
who came down from New York 
with Dispose, took easy gallops. 
Those on hand earlier did little, 
these including Our Boots, Porter’s 
Cap, Whirlaway, Mrs. Louise Pal- 
ladino’s Little Beans, Cleaveland 
Putnam’s Swain and Emerson F. 
Woodward's Valdina Paul. 

It was admitted by Trainer Willie 
Crump that Mrs. Vera S. Bragg’s 
Blue Pair really had a leg injury 
and a saddle sore despite the 
1:36 3-5 mile he ran in winning the 
Derby Trial yesterday. 

Ticket speculators were reported 
in downtown Louisville to be charg- 
ing $150 for ordinary $100 club- 
house boxes and $125 for those 
which usually sell at $85 in the 
grandstand. 


160 Police on Traffic Duty 


The Police Department, making 
the usual pre-Derby arrangements, 
assigned 162 officers on traffic 
duty in the city. There will be no 
National Guard at the Downs this 

ear, but 600 State militiamen and 

40 ROTC cadets will take its 
place. 

I. J. Collina’s Royal Martha es- 
tablished herself as one of the fleet- 
est 2-year-old fillies in the West as 
she romped to a five-length victory 
in the forty-first debutante stakes 
in the forty-first Debutante Stakes

DO YOU REALIZE how much progress there really 
has been in the last decade? Make the comparison 
for women’s fashions... automobiles...the movies 


... for many things. What an improvement a dec- 
ade has made! 
And you'll find the same thing true in cigars—if 
you look to White Owl. Constant improvements 
in manufacturing methods have made it possible 
for White Owl to bring smokers a far better cigar 
today ... and at lower cost. 


How about your present cigar? Has it been 

kept up to date as the years went by—or are 
you still smoking cigars of a decade ago? 

Light up a White Owl and you'll see what a 


1941 cigar should taste like. Discover today’s 
standards for mildness and Havana flavor.

nitely and denied the privileges of

ston, the horse’s groom, also has 
been suspended indefinitely. 

“Since the horse’s ownership was 
in the name of Coburn’s wife, Mrs. 
J. A. Coburn, under the rules of 

icing was decided to suspend

continued to fall to a 
slower pace today and all Ameri- 
can Bowling Congress leaders held 
their places for the third consecu-

tourney reaching its closing stages, 
few expect the topnotchers to be 
dethroned before finis is written 
next Tuesday. Several outstanding 
Keglers, including Charley Daw of 
Milwaukee, former ABC and match 
champion, and Joe Falcaro of New 
York, former match titleholder, are 
still to bowl, however.

$50,000,000 Is Expected to Be

for Defense Program 


$95,000,000 IN REFUNDING 


5Vos Due in 1943 Would Be 
Called—$140,000,000 Sale 
Last December 


The management of the American 
Telephone and Telegraph Company 
is considering a large-scale finan- 
cing program which will involve 
issuance of approximately $150,000,- 
000 of new securities, it was learned 
yesterday. More than $50,000,000 is 
expected to be used for new con- 
struction and expansion to meet the 
increasing demands of national de- 
fense on Bell System facilities. In- 
mluded in the proposed financing, 
which would be the largest to reach 
the market in many years, would 
be refunding of $95,000,000 of A. T. 
& T. 5% per cent debentures due 
on Nov. 1, 1943 

Last December 
raised $140,000,000 of new capital 
through sale of 2%, per cent deben- 
tures to a group of insurance com- 
panies. Proceeds were used entire- 
ly to replenish the working capital 
of the Bell System and to prepare 
it for the heavy demands for service 
expected to arise out of national 
defense activities. 


Convertible Debentures 


According to present indications, 
officials of A. T. & T. intend to un- 
dertake the proposed financing pro- 
gram on a convertible debenture 
issue basis. Such development 
would be in line with the Bell Sys- 
tem’s attitude on funded debt per- 
centages. The system always has 
followed a conservative course in 
issuance of funded debt obligations 
with the result that on Dec. 31, 
1940, total debt obligations of the 
entire system were $1,234,000,000, 
or less than 32 per cent of the ag- 
gregate capital obligations out- 
standing at that time. Sale of a 
convertible debenture issue would 
provide a method for ultimate con- 
version of such obligations into 
capital stock of A. T. & T. 

In the company’s recently issued 
annual report Walter S. Gifford, 
president, said of the system’s low 
ratio of funded debt that ‘‘the 
soundness of this financial struc- 
ture means much in the ability of 
the system to weather depressions 
and to meet the demands of nation- 
al defense.”’ 

At the end of 1940 the consoli- 
dated cash position of the Bell Sys- 
tem amounted to approximately 
$230,000,000 and the excess of cur- 
rent assets over current liabilities 
was about $140,000,000. Consider- 
able cash is believed to have been 
utilized since the first of the year 
for rapid expansion of Bell System 
facilities for national defense. 


the company 


New Construction 


According to present estimates, 
which are subject to possible up- 
ward revision, the system will spend 
about $400,000,000 for new construc- 
tion in 1941, an increase of $110,- 
000,000 over last year. In 1940 the 
Bell System had a gain of more 
than 950,000 telephones, the largest 
for any year in its history. This 
year, it is estimated, the increase 
in telephones will number about 
1,500,000, or 50 per cent more than 
ever before in one year. Long-dis- 
tance traffic is running from 25 to 
30 per cent ahead of a year ago. 
Superimposed on all this unprece- 
dented activity is the additional ex- 
pansion required to meet the de- 
mands of the Army and Navy and 
other branches of the Federal Gov- 
ernment, with special installations 
for defense establishments. 

In telephone circles it was said 
that the $50,000,000 of new money 
to be raised by A. T. & T. repre- 
sented the minimum figure under} 
discussion. Subject to changing 
conditions and demands of the de- 
fense program in the immediate 
future, this figure may be revised 
upward. 

With regard to A. T. & T.’s out- 
standing $95,000,000 of 54 per cent 
debentures due on Nov. 1, 1943, the 
call price on this issue will drop to- 
day from 110 to 100. The bonds are 
selling at 102%. 


URGES FEDERAL ECONOMY 


Boston Bank for Curb on Other 
Costs as Defense Bill Rises 


Arguing that as expenditures for 
national defense increase there must 
be economies in other lines of gov- 
ernmental activity, the First Na- 
tional Bank of Boston in its month- 
ly New England letter, released yes- 
terday, declares that ‘‘no time 
should be lost in eliminating waste 
and extravagance which now men- 
ace our security.”’ 

The bank adds that it would be 
highly desirable that the public re- 
frain from buying more goods than 
are absolutely essential, and place 
the surplus funds in savings. 

‘“‘Raids on the Treasury by pres- 
sure groups are an unwarranted 
drain on our resources that should 
not be countenanced at any time, | 
especially in this critical period,’’ 
the bank continues. ‘‘The relief load 
should be reduced as employment | 
and payrolls are increased. State 
and local budgets should be kept 
strictly within bounds.”’

‘Stocks End Worst Month Since Last May; Prices| 
Sag as Much as 3 Points in Final Session 


Individual weaknesses cropped out 
yesterday in several selective 
sues, and the tendency in the stock 
markets quickly spread to the re- 
mainder of the share list, with final 
prices showing reductions of as 
much as 3 points. The session 
brought to a close the severest in- 
roads to values for any month since 
llast May, while the month itself 
witnessed trading volume which 
was the smallest in twenty-three 
years. Transfers for the day on the 
Stock Exchange were only 406,350 
shares, compared with 511,990 on 
Tuesday. The industrial section 
took the brunt of the selling, with 
the averages there entering the 
lowest territory since 1938. 

Gloom over the war outlook 
reached a new low mark in Wall 
Street, despite the counseling from 
Washington that things were not so 
desperate as the news would indi- 
cate. Most brokers feel that the 
situation in the securities markets 
could be righted to some extent if 
holders of stocks and bonds had a 
clearer picture of what to expect in 
income and excess profits taxes. In 
this respect it noticeable that 
much of the weakness of late has 
appeared in the higher priced and 
selective stocks. Nervousness by 
holders of such stocks invariably is 
catching 

Many blank spaces in the inter- 
national cross-word puzzle were 
shaded slightly yesterday by vari- 
ous bits of news. Financial circles 
asked if the reported plan of Wash- 
ington to requisition some of the 
commercial planes of the large air- 


is- 


iS 


lines for shipment to Great Britain | 
and countries at war with the Axis | 


powers was but a forerunner to 
more general requisition of peace- 
time equipment in other lines. 
Significant, also, was the voting 
down by the Senate Foreign Rela- 
tions Committee, at the request of 
the Administration, of an anti- 
convoy resolution. Then there was 
the report via Moscow of a landing 
12,000 Nazi troops and heavy 
equipment in Finland. All in all, 
Wall Street saw the beginning of a 
movement which would submerge 
most peace-time endeavors. 

News that the House had passed 
the 75-per-cent-of-parity loan bill 
for grain brought an immediate re- 
sponse in many of the principal 
commodities. While wheat prices 
had an early enthusiastic rally, 
liquidation quickly followed and 
drove values back to the previous 
close. Cotton futures were pushed 
ahead 10 to 20 points, and hides, 
rubber and cocoa advanced. The 
grain bill calls for loans of 75 per 
cent of the parity price on wheat, 
which had been set at $1.13 a 
bushel.

Many prime stocks were off to

as American Telephone dropped 3

in American Airlines and 3% points

not in the same ratio as the trans- |

are that it was an important factor 


over February, 


and that it will be increasingly so in

abroad under its provisions for only

However, since 
that portion of exports sent abroad 
in accordance with the lend-lease 
bill, and since all nations are de-

into this country, it is quite likely 
that there will be a diminution of 
the amount of gold coming here. 
In fact, it is not improbable that 
part of this country’s huge stocks 
of the metal may be redistributed 
if this country’s efforts to aid for- 
eign nations in their war effort con- 
tinue over a long period.

Investment Market 


Signs of increased activity and in- 
| vestment interest in the market for 
|/new securities continued to perme- 
jate financial quarters yesterday. 
The competition displayed among 
investment firms for the two new 
jissues of railroad equipment trust 
|certificates was a concrete demon- 
}stration of not only the continued 
high regard with which those ob- 
ligations are held in investment cir- 
cles but also of renewed faith on 
the part of the purchasers that 
there is always an investment port- 
folio open to equipments despite 
the relativély low yield. A major 
|industrial bond refunding and new 
money financing operation also ma- 
terialized yesterday when the Fire- 
stone Tire and Rubber Company 
filed a $50,000,000 issue. In the tax- 
|exempt field officials of Detroit fi- 
inally have decided on May 7 for 
the date of the sale of $51,157,000 of 
jrefunding bonds. These newcomers, 
together with the several large loans 
already in incubation, indicate a 
sharp pick-up in new financing ac- 
tivity, barring an unexpected dis- 
turbance to the market.

‘Only Bonds Will Be Taken— 

Purpose Is to See That 
Capital Is Available 


Special to THe New York Times. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Jesse 
Jones, Federal Loan Administrator, 
announced today at his press con- 
ference that he approved the new 
rule of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that there must be 
competitive bidding by underwrit- 
|ers for issues of securities of pub- 
|lic utilities and that the Recon- 
| Struction Finance Corporation was 





|} handle them. 

Mr. Jones’s announcement, which 
was made after a conference re- 
}cently with Chairman Eichers and 
Commissioners Healey and Pike of 


the SEC, was interpreted to mean | 


}that the RFC would bid for utility 
issues if the 
|failed to do so. This was regarded 
jas insuring the success of the new 
bidding rule, which the investment 
bankers have opposed. 

The proposed issue of $120,000,- 
000 by the Columbia Gas and Elec- 
tric Corporation was mentioned by 
Mr. Jones as the sort of offering on 
which the RFC might well bid be- 
cause of its unusual size. Although 
he was heartily in favor of competi- 
tive bidding, he said, there were 
cases where it might not be practi- 
cal. Columbia could be such an is- 
|sue because of the very 
|amount involved. 

“But we won't bid on Columbia 





: : lif the bankers can handle it at a| 
stock and a reduction of 1% points | 


decent rate,’’ he said. 


not have effect except on issues 
registered after May 7 and the Col- 
umbia issue was registered earlier, 
|competitive bidding would not be 
|compulsory in its case. However, 
the commission“has not yet ap- 
| proved the application and there is 


some doubt whether it will do so. | 


| Nevertheless the RFC has indicated 
| its willingness to make an offer. 


| Administrator’s Statement 


“I think the competitive bidding 
| rule is right,’’ Mr. Jones said. ‘‘The 
SEC thinks, of course, that in some 


| cases utilities have been run in the| 
Lehigh Valley Coal issues | 


interests of the bankers rather than 
of their stockholders or the public. 


| The RFC will participate in bidding | 


for utility issues only if they are 
|so large that the bankers cannot 
| handle them. We would cooperate 


cooperate with the bankers, not to 
compete but to make credit avail- 
able. That is quite consistent with 
what I told the United States 
Chamber of Commerce yesterday 
about my being opposed to the ex- 
tension of great participation in 
business. We have been willing to 


the TVA, 

‘‘What I favor is bidding that pro- 
| duces fair terms which the borrow- 
er can meet. Competitive bidding 
may not be practicable where the 
size of the issue is too great, and 
| Columbia may be such a case.’’ 


Will Not Bid for Stocks 





| the subject with the SEC. The RFC, 
| he said, would bid only for issues of 
| bonds, not common stocks, and if it 
| bought them would sell them again 
| when the market was right. As in 
| the case of the Arkansas bonds, the 
| RFC would be willing to bid for part 

of an issue in cooperation with the 
|investment bankers or for all of it 
j}and to cocperate with them after- 
| ward in its resale. 


| The competitive bidding rule dis- | 
| places one made by the SEC under 
the Public Utility Holding Company | 


| Act which prescribed ‘‘arm’s-length 
| bargaining.’’ In practice this proved 
almost unworkable in the commis- 
sion’s opinion. It led to such deci- 
sions as that Morgan Stanley & Co., 
Inc., were not entitled to underwrit- 
| ers’ fees in handling an issue by the 
| Dayton Power and Light Company 
| because they were affiliated. 


LOAN FOR CUBA IN VIEW 


Carrying Sugar 


Special to Toe NEw Yorx TIMEs. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Cuba 
may get a loan soon, according to 
Jesse Jones, Federal Loan Adminis- 
trator. Ambassador George S. Mes- 
sersmith, Mr. 
| day, was here from Cuba and has 
been discussing Cuba’s requirements 
with 
Corporation, 

“They seem reasonable,’’ the Ad- 
ministrator remarked, ‘‘and I think 


ricultural development and some 
public works.’’ He added that War- 
ren Pierson, head of the Export- 
Import Bank, would sign an $11,- 
000,000 sugar-carrying loan in Ha- 
vana on his way back to Washing- 
ton from his tour of South America. 

Mr. Jones said an informal appli- 
cation for a loan had been received 
from Colombia. No money, he added, 
had yet been paid to Argentina on 
its loan. 

Congress, said Mr. Jones, would 
soon be asked to pass the necessary 
legislation for the establishment of 
the Inter-American Bank, It would 
not supplant the Export-Import 
Bank, which now was dealing with 
Latin-American demands for credit. 

There have been some further dis- 
cussions with the RFC of loans 
against British assets such as that 
recently announced against the as- 
sets of the Brown & Williamson To- 
bacco Company. Mr. Jones said 
Brown & Williamson could not have 
been sold as a going concern, s0 
that the RFC by its loan had pro- 
vided the British Government with 
as much money to pay for muni- 
tions ordered here as they could 
possibly have obtained by a knock- 
down sale of the company.

Summarizing results for 1940 in 
the company’s thirteenth annual re- 


lavantenent bankers | Port, J. T. Trippe, president and 


general manager of Pan Ameri- 
can Airways Corporation, told 
stockholders yesterday that under 


the handicap of disturbed world| 


conditions and enhanced competi- 


tion from European lines in South | 


America the corporation had com- 


pleted the most successful year in | 
its history and vastly improved its | 


financial position. 

Net income, after taxes, amount- 
ed to $2,256,318, and was equal to 
$1.19 each on Pan American’s 1,887,- 
355 outstanding shares of capital 
stock. Net income in 1939 was 
$1,984,438 

Gross income 
334,117 last year, from $20,610,930 
operating costs and in- 
come deductions, including taxes, 
rose to $25,077,799 from $18,626,492, 
while the company’s tax bill, ex- 
cluding sales taxes, was $1,549,441 


in 1940, against $926,709 the year | 


before, 
Current Assets Sharply Up 


The consolidated balance sheet as | 
|of Dec. 31 last shows current as-| 


sets of $11,815,401, including $5,472,- 
927 cash, and current liabilities of 
$6,633,352. These figures compare 
with current assets of $8,367,068 at 
the end of 1939, of which cash 


}amounted to $1,963,597 and current 


liabilities of $6,169,187. 

During last year Pan American 
spent $5,067,000 for new flight 
equipment and to provide new 
ground facilities. In addition, $675,- 
000 was deposited against the pur- 
chase of aircraft for future de- 
livery. Commitments for aircraft 
and other capital assets aggregated 
about $10,000,000 at the end of the 
year. 


Financing Plan Included 


The statement reflects effects of 
the company’s financing program 
concluded on March 1, 1940. Under 
this 525,391 additional shares of 
capital stock were offered to stock- 
holders, certain officers and em- 
ployes by means of warrants. War- 
rant holders subscribed to 99.02 per 
cent of the issue, or 520,220 shares, 
providing $6,250,000 net of new 
funds. In the meantime, 50,000 
shares of stock in the treasury were 
retired, leaving 1,887,355 outstand- 
ing. 

Route miles operated by Pan 
American companies last year were 


|at record high level of 72,615 miles,

less than in 1939, Mr. 
Stanley said. He disclosed that the 
projected capital outlay in 1941 
would provide for increasing the 
ratio of low-grade ore to high-grade 
ore mined and furnishing capacity 
to treat an increased tonnage from 
the mines. 

“Copper production resulting from 
increased nickel output and from 
the treatment of Falconbridge Bes- 
semer matte,’’ he added, ‘‘exceeded 
the capacity of our copper refinery

Three leading steel companies re- 
ported yesterday their best first- 
quarter earnings in four years de- 
spite considerably higher taxes for 
the current year. The National 
Steel Corporation showed a rise in 
net profit of 37 per cent, the Inland 
Steel Company reported a gain of 49 
per cent and the Wheeling Steel 
Corporation had an increase of 200 
per cent, compared with the first |

National Steel earned $5,430,389 
in the first quarter after $2,245,419 
provision for Federal income and 
excess profits taxes. The net was 
equal to $2.46 each on 2,204,667 cap- 
ital shares. It compared with $4,-| 
009,193, or $1.82 a share, after $813,- 
909 income taxes the year before. 
Profit in the final quarter of 1940 
was $6,271,187, or $2.84 a share. The 
best previous first-quarter profit 
was $5,695,819, or $2.63 a share, in 
1937. 

Inland Steel reported for the first 
quarter a net profit of $4,555,118, 
equal to $2.79 a share on the capital 
stock, compared with $3,059,844, or 


1940. In the final quarter of 1940 
profit was $4,561,901, or $2.80 a 
share, and in the first quarter of 
1937 it was $5,008,774, or $3.34 a 


dend of $1 a share, the same as de- 
clared three months ago. Federal 
income and excess profits taxes 
were $3,888,712, against $736,500 in 
the first quarter of 1940. 


Wheeling Steel 


Wheeling Steel’s net profit in the 
first quarter was $1,981,009, equal, 
after preferred dividend require- 
ments, to $2.64 a share on the com- 
mon stock, against $644,652, or 29 
cents a share, in the 1940 period. 
In the final quarter of 1940 the 
company earned $2,388,744, or $3.32 
a common share. Federal income 
taxes in the first quarter were 
$850,284, compared with $151,296 the | 
year before. Net sales were $28,287,- 
027, against $18,678,820. 

William W. Holloway, president, 
was elected chairman of Wheeling 
Steel to succeed the late Alexander 
Glass. Elevated to the presidency 
was Archie J. McFarland, formerly 
executive vice president. Arthur C. 
Stifel, a director, was elected to the 
executive committee, and L. W. 
Franzheim, vice president and treas- 
urer, was elected a director, filling 
vacancies caused by the death of 
Mr. Glass. 

Edward L. Ryerson, chairman of 
Inland Steel, said yesterday after a 
meeting of the board in Chicago 
that ‘‘any appraisal of future earn- 
ings must take into consideration 
the increased costs of production 
resulting from general advances in 
wages of the steel industry which 
became effective April 1 and also 
such further changes in tax sched- 
ules as undoubtedly will be made 
effective during the current year.”’ 


Steadiness in Prices 


“The prices of our products,’’ he 
added, ‘‘are in general the same as 
those which prevailed prior to the 
outbreak of the European war and 
the inauguration of our defense 
program. We are mindful of the in- 
terest of our stockholders in the 
difficult and unusual situation now 
confronting us and believe that 
their interests merit consideration 
no less than those of the employes 
of the company. While we are al- 
ways eager to cooperate to the full- 
est extent possible in behalf of the 
national welfare and those in charge 
of governmental policy, it is our 
hope that in the near future a solu- 
tion will be found which will bring 
about a proper balance between the 
interests of all concerned.’’ 

The company produced 868,775 
tons of ingots in the first quarter, 
the highest for any quarter in its 
history, and a rate of 106.7 per cent | 
of theoretical capacity. Employ- | 
ment and payrolls also made new | 
high records, with average employ- 
ment of 20,891 in the quarter. Or-/| 
ders received were ‘‘considerably in | 
excess’’ of capacity. National de-| 
fense tonnage increased heavily.

$2,000,000 today to’ Carrol M. 


Shanks, reorganization manager of 


the new company which will oper- 


afe the line. 


The transfer was on the steps of 
the Princess Anne County Court- 
house under terms of an order au- 
thorizing a foreclosure sale entered 


through the Federal District Court | 


by W. B. Rodman, special master 


and confirmed by Judge Luther B. 


Way. 

Morris 8. Hawkins will be the 
president of the new company. The 
names of other officers have not 
been announced. 


Mr. Shanks is vice president and 
general solicitor of the Prudential 
Insurance Company of America, 
one of the many fiduciary institu- 
tions which has had to take an 
active part in railroading because 
of the numerous bankruptcies and 
receiverships in that field in recent 
years. 

The sale to Mr. Shanks will go 
before the District Court in Nor- 
folk on May 14 next for confirma- 
tion. 

More than 92 per cent of Nor- 
folk Southern bonds have been 
deposited under the plan of reor- 
ganization, it was made known by 
Mr. Shanks. The time _ within 
which deposits may be made under 
the plan was extended to May 15 
next. 

Holders of Norfolk Southern 
bonds who do not deposit their 
bonds with the reorganization man- 
ager will receive their distributive 
share of the purchase price of the 
properties after deducting expenses. 
The distributive share of non- 
depositing bondholders’ will be 
determined by apportioning the 
purchase price, less expenses, 
among the various issues according 
to upset prices fixed by the District 
Court. 

The percentages of Norfolk 
Southern bonds on deposit with the 
reorganization manager were stat- 
ed by Mr. Shanks to be about as 
follows: 

Norfolk & Southern first mort- 
gage bonds, 98 per cent; Raleigh & 
Cape Fear Railway first mortgage 
bonds, 96.3 per cent; Raleigh & 
Southport Railway first mortgage 
bonds, 93.6 per cent; Aberdeen & 
Asheboro Railroad first mortgage 
bonds, 96.9 per cent; Norfolk & 
Southern Railroad first general 
mortgage bonds, 95 per cent; Nor-

FIRESTONE ISSUE: FILED 


Asks SEC Permission to Offer 
$50,000,000 Debentures 


Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Appli- 
cation for the issue of $50,000,000 
of twenty-year 3 per cent deben- 
tures due May 1, 1961, was filed to- 
day by the Firestone Tire and Rub- 
ber Company at the Cleveland re- 
gional office of the Securities and 


Exchange Commission. 

Proceeds from the sale of the se- 
curities are to be applied to the 
redemption, at 103, of $44,600,000 
principal amount of ten-year 3% 
per cent debentures, due Oct. 1 
The balance will be added 





Harriman Ripley & Co., Inc., New 
York City, and Otis & Co., Cleve- 
land, will be the principal under- 
writers. The names of the other 
underwriters, the underwriting dis- 
counts or commissions, the offering 
price to the public, and the redemp- 
tion provisions will be filed by 
amendment. 

The prospectus states that to fa- 
cilitate the offering it is intended to 
stabilize the price of the deben- 
tures. 


Erie Equipment Issues 


The offering was made subject to 


authorization by the Interstate Com- | 


merce Commission. 


Associated with Salomon Brothers | 


& Hutzler in the offering were Dick 
& Merle-Smith and Stroud & Co., 
Ine. 

Lazard Fréres and associates, who 
were successful in a field of seven 
competitors, reoffered the $4,000,- 
000 of Erie 1% per cent certificates 
at prices to yield from 0.45 to 2.20 
per cent, according to maturity. 
They will mature serially on May 1, 
1942 to 1951. The successful bid rep- 
resented an interest cost to the car- 
rier of 1.86 per cent. 

Other members of the Lazard 
Fréres offering group were Kidder, 


Peabody & Co., the Union Securities | 


Corporation and Harris, Hall & Co., 
Ine. 

The Erie certificates were awarded 
on a 20 per cent equity basis. Bid- 
ders had the option to bid for the 
issue either on a 20 or 10 per cent 
equity basis. 


In recent years Mr. Willard has 
|had to tackle financial problems, 


| financial structure to avert a bond 
default which would have resulted 
in the road’s bankruptcy. This, of 
course, entailed negotiations with 
financial interests holding B. & O. 
' bonds. 

As a former member of a railroad 
union he has been successful in 
| maintaining relations between man- 
{agement and labor on the B. & O. 
which in respect to harmony have 
been surpassed by no other carrier. 


Willard Now the Chairman 


The B. & O. management estab- 
lished the position of chairman of 
the board yesterday and elected Mr. 
Willard to that office. His resigna- 
tion as president of the B. & O, 
was accepted as effective when Mr. 
White became president. It has 
been Mr. Willard’s custom for more 
than a decade to offer his resigna- 
tion as president before each meet-« 
ing of the directors called for the 
election of officers. This custom 
aroused reports of his resignation 
from time to time in recent years. 

Mr. Willard considers that his out- 
| standing achievements in the field 
which he chose as a career were 
the adjustment of the B. & O.’s 
capitalization which averted its 
| bankruptcy and his success in per- 
suading the railroad labor unions 
to accept a 10 per cent wage reduc- 
tion in 1931. This cut was effected 
in less time than was taken up by 
any other like negotiations. As it 
|turned out, labor turned a good 
bargain, because reductions in other 
industries reached more than 10 per 
cent in many instances after 1931. 

Mr. Willard entered railroad serve 
| ice on April 8, 1879, as track laborer 
;on the Central Vermont Railroad, 
He later served as fireman and then 
| engineer, and then became assistant 
| to the president of the Erie Raik 

road in June, 1901. 

In 1911, Mr. Willard was made 
president of the American Railway 
Association. Soon after the decla- 
ration of war against the Central 
Powers in 1917, he was elected to 
bring about the organization of the 
Railroad War Board and later was 
sent to France as Colonel of Engi- 
neers for service in the transporta- 
tion section. 

Mr. Willard has received the de- 
gree of Doctor of Laws from eleven 
universities and colleges and the 
Doctor of Business Administration 
from Syracuse Dniversity. Ata tes- 
timonial dinner on Jan. 13, 1930, the 
labor organization of the Baltimore 
& Ohio conferred its own degree on 
him as ‘‘Doctor of Humanity.” 


Felicitations by Western Union 


Directors of the Western Union 
Telegraph Company issued a state- 
ment in which they said: 

“The directors and officers of 
Western Union deeply regret Mr. 
White’a retirement from the presi- 
dency, which office he has occupied 
with briant results for nearly 
eight years, and they wish him hap- 
piness and success in his new re 
| sponsiMilities. His return to the 
| industry and the company in which 
he began his business life is ro- 
mantic and understandable. 
| “Mr. White will continue as @ 
director of Western Union. His 
successor as president has not yet 
| been chosen.” 
| For twenty-odd years ending in 
| 1926 Mr. White was associated with 
the Baltimore & Ohio, having start- 
led his career as a telegraph oper- 
lator and agent. It is said he will 
| assume his new duties after he has 
larranged to leave the Western 
| Union Telegraph Company. 
| Mr. White’s salary with the West 
lern Union was more than $80,000 
lannually. Mr. Willard’s salary was 
| $60,000.

Special to THE NEW YorK TIMES 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Domi- 
nance of New York underwriting 
firms in the flotation of securities 
again is indicated in a summary by 
the Securities and Exchange Com- 
mission covering the first quarter 
of the current year. Of the $405,- 
324,000 of underwritten issues regis- 
tered under the Securities Act, New 
York City firms in sixty-eight re- 
ported participations of $262,766,000, 
or 64.5 per cent of the total. One 
hundred and seventy-three firms 
outside New York City, or almost 
three times as many, took part in 
the flotations, but the aggregate 
amount was only $142,558,000, or 
30.2 ver cent. 

The 405,324,000 of underwritten 
issues during the first three months 
of this year involved 241 under- 
writers handling forty-seven issues. 

In the preceding quarter, partici- 
pations totaled $657,857,000 for 277 
firms involving sixty-four issues, 
while in the first quarter of 1940 
participations equaled $365,533,000 
for 201 firms covering forty-two 
issues. 

Underwriting participations for 
the first three months of 1941 were 
principally in bonds, twenty-two 
such issues accounting for $300,000,- 
000, or 74.0 per cent of all the oper- 
ations. This compared with par- 
ticipations in sixteen preferred 
stock issues amounting to $87,354,- 
000, or 21.6 per cent, and nine com- 
mon stock issues amounting to $17,- 
969,000, or 4.4 per cent. 

The five ranking houses in terms 
of the amount of underwriting par- 
ticipations were all New York City 
firms, as follows: The First Boston 
Corporation, $24,468,500; Smith, 
Barney & Co., $21,910,250; Blyth & 
Co., Inc., $20,484,375; Harriman 

Ripley & Co., Inc., $18,973,875; Mor- 
gan Stanley & Co., Inc., $16,885,- 
000. These five firms together had 
participations of $102,722,000, or 25.3 
per cent of the total. 

Relative to the amount of under- 
written issues managed, the five 
leading houses also were all New 
York City firms, as follows: Mor- 
gan Stanley & Co., Inc., $71,250,000; 
the First Boston Corporation, $55,- 
| 180,000; Kuhn, Loeb & Co., $42,000,- 
000; Blyth & Co., Inc., $37,500,000; 


‘| Dillon, Read & Co., $36,859,524. The 


aggregate managed by these five 
firms combined was $242,789,524, or 
59.9 per cent of the total 

In the management of underwrit- 
ten issues the predominance of New 
York City firms was even greater. 
Only seventeen New York City 
firms acted managers, account- | 
ing for $329,249,000, or 81.2 per cent 
of the total amount managed. The 
proportionate amount managed by 
such firms was 82.3 per cent for 
bonds, 76.0 per cent for preferred 
stock and 89.1 per cent for common 
stock. 

Only sixteen firms outside of New 
York City acted as qanagers and 
two of these firms accounted for | 
$49,974,000 of the total of $76,075,000 
managed by these sixteen firms.

Discussing some of the difficulties

inflation were to be avoided drastic 
rise in prices must be prevented. 

“In view of increases in taxes and | 
|labor,’’ he said, “industry has to| 
face a real problem in attempting 
| to pay these increased expenses and | 
make a profit without raising the 
price of its product.

| crease, operated to reduce earnings.

merce of the United States that 
“the business man of tomorrow’”’ 
had a choice of ‘‘revolution by con- 
sent, in peace, wrought by intelli- 
gent and patriotic men, or the ter- 
rible and senseless upheaval of 
masses with hatred _ in 
hearts,’’ seeking to bring about a 
better social order, preserving the 
American free enterprise system in 
which humanitarianism would dis- 
place materialism to make possible 
“fullness of life for all men every- 
where.’’ When Bishop Oxnam con- 
cluded, all the delegates rose to 
their feet applauding. 

Considerable significance was at- 
tached to the labor program ad- 
vanced by Albert W. Hawkes of 
Kearny, N. J., president of Congo- 
leum-Nairn, Inc., as it became 
known that he was among two or 
three top leaders in the Chamber 


who were under consideration for | 


president of the group, replacing 
James §. Kemper of Chicago, 
whose successor will be elected by 
the board of directors at tomor- 
row’s final session. 


New Labor-Capital Program 


Discussing “An Employer's 
View” in a labor relations panel 
with Dr. John R. Steelman, Direc- 
tor of the United States Concilia- 
tion Service, and Chester M. 
Wright of Washington, editor of a 
privately circulated labor letter, 
Mr. 
program for labor and capital: 

“1. Labor and capital must re- 
member that public opinion right 
now is condemning much in the ac- 
tions of some of labor and some of 
capital. One of the most important 
things for us to do 
understand each other. 


agement band together in a com- 
mon cause and preserve our way of | 
life. Each must determine to do 
equity as well as ask equity. 

‘2. Labor and capital must re- 
member that the voluntary coopera- 
tion which is so necessary for maxi- 
mum success cannot be legislated. 
It must grow from mutual confi- 
dence and faith, based on a multi- 
plicity of experiences, with a fair 
common objective for all. 

“3. Labor and capital must re- 
member that patience and tolerance 


are vital factors in finding a solu-| 


tion to the human relations prob- 
lem, Both sides can well afford to 
agree voluntarily to conciliate or 
arbitrate most questions when nec- 
essary to settle differences in the 
interest of themselves and the 
public 

‘‘Neither employers nor employe 
has any right to make any un- 
American demand upon the other 
during this national defense period, 
and neither has any right to resort 
to unlawful methods to gain its| 
end. 

‘‘4. Capital is often called ‘stored 
up’ hours of labor. Workers pro- 
duce ‘current’ hours of labor. It 
behooves each side to endeavor to 
see that ‘current’ hours of labor | 
and ‘stored up’ hours of labor do 
not either take an unfair advantage 
of the other. A fair balance in this 
equation will 
curity for all. 
, 
remember that the rights of neither 
can be destroyed without direct 
damage to rights of both. 

‘6. Labor and capital must re- 
member that neither will be suc- 
cessful in this new era unless each 
has leadership of character, which 
makes and keeps fair agreements 
and has respect for the maintenance 
of law and order and for private 
property 
owners

through Monday total $825,526,000, 


including more than $120,000,000 
awarded during the last two weeks,

cent of their 1939 sales, or $710,684,- | 


000, against $167,965,000. 

If Bethlehem Steel, which recent- 
ly received cargo vessel contracts 
for almost $20,000,000 and whose de- 
fense business is largely shipbuild- 
ing, also were included, defense 
shipbuilding contracts to date for 
the four companies would total 
nearly $2,000,000,000. 

Eight leading industrial concerns 
receiving defense contracts during 
the last fortnight (including those 
above-named, except Cramp Ship- 
building) have received defense 


awards to date equal to 101.6 per |fense awards, an amount exceeded | 


cent of their 1939 sales. These 
awards total $2,175,409,000, as shown 
in the table, compared with 1939 
sales of $2,140,363,000. If Ford and 
Cramp Shipbuilding, for which 1939 
sales data are lacking but which 
also have received important recent 
awards, are included, the contract 
total is increased to $2,419,908,000. 
If subcontracts could also be includ- 
ed the total would be still greater. 
About $215,000,000 additional is 
represented by plant-expansion con- 
tracts awarded to most of these con- 
cerns, or by government commit- 
ments for additional facilities in the 


form of letters of intent. These con- | 


tracts and commitments imply 
heavy contracts against the output 


of the new facilities, which in many | 


cases have not yet been reduced to 
formal awards.

Chicago at About the Low 
Levels for Session 


WHEAT SOFTENS 1% CENT 


V, Cent a} 


Bushel—Rye, Oats and Soy 
Beans Also Decline 


| Corn Is Down % to 


Special to THE NEw YorK Times. 
CHICAGO, April 30—The grain | 
markets opened on a strong note 








the session. Wheat was run up 1% 
cents a bushel and soy beans 1% 
cents in the early trading, but there 
was no zest in the buying, and the 
upturn was attributed as much to 
light offerings as to anything else. 

Persistent selling developed later 


through commission houses, which 
found the demand slow. Prices as 
a result worked gradually lower 
until late in the session, when scat- 
tered liquidation by the holders of 
May contracts developed. 

Closing quotations on futures were | 
about at the low levels of the day. 
Wheat ended at losses of % to % 
cent, corn was off *% to % cent and 
| oats declined % to % cent. 

Tenders of 1,009,000 bushels of 
cash rye on May contracts led to 
general selling late in the session 
and the market weakened rapidly, 
with the close 1% to 1% cents lower 
than Tuesday. 


Beans React on Seasonal Peak 


May soy beans sold at a new high 
level for the season early, but re- 
acted later and finished % to 1% 
cents down. 

Brokers, in commenting on the 
action of the wheat market, said 
it apparently had discounted adop- 
tion of the Fulmer bill in the House, 
and, in addition, there was reported 
to be much uncertainty as to what 
}action the Senate finally will take. 
|In some quarters a disposition is 
|apparent to await additional devel- 
|opments as to the amount that will 
|be advanced on grain at terminal 
markets. The basic loan rate based 
on 75 per cent of parity would be 
about 85 cents at the farm, com- 
pared with 64 cents last year, The 
basic rate for loans in Chicago was 
81 cents in 1940, or 17 cents above | 
lthe average farm price for the 
whole country. 

A few small lots of loan wheat 
were redeemed by farmers and sold 
to handlers here as the result of the 
early bulge in the market, but it 
generally is expected that only a 
little grain will appear hereafter. 
No tenders on May contracts were 
submitted. 

Private Estimates Tomorrow 

Private estimates on the Winter 
wheat crop will be issued by local 
statisticians early on Friday. Re- 
ports are current that a yield of 
630,000,000 to 640,000,000 bushels 
may be shown, compared with 616,- 
000,000 on April 1. Last year’s har- 
vest Avas 589,000,000 bushels. 

Corn was firm for most of the 
session, but it began to ease in the 
late dealings in consonance with 
the trend in the other grains, and 
final quotations were only slightly 
better than the lowest levels of the 
day. May, however, equaled its 
seasonal high level in early trading. 

There was fair activity in spread- 
ing between the May and the Sep- 
tember at around % cent premium 
for September, with cash houses 
absorbing the scattered liquidation 
in the May. No tenders of cash 
'grain on the May contracts ap- 
peared. 

Shipping sales of cash corn were 
140,000 bushels, while 36,000 bushels 
were bought for deferred shipment 
from the country. 


Irregularity in Secondary Grains 


Plowing for corn is reported to| 
have made rapid progress in the last 
few days and a little has been 
planted in Southern Illinois and In- 
diana. 

Liquidation in small lots by the 
holders of May oats caused some 
easiness in quotations. Similar sell- 


ing by holders of May rye was a! 
sorbed by cash interests, who, in 
turn sold the September at 8 cents 
premium. , 
Local operators were aggressive 
on the buying side of the soy bean | 
market early in line with strength 
in cottonseed oil and lard. The 
market, however, had to _absorb 
broad hedging sales, especially in 
the July and price eased rapidly. 
No tenders of cash beans on fu- 
ture contracts appeared. No. 2 yel- 
low sold in the spot market at the 


May price to % cent premium. _

LIVESTOCK IN CHICAGO 


CHICAGO, April 30 (AP)—Hogs ad- 
vancea 10 to 15 cents, cattle declined 10 to 
25 cents and fed lambs closed steady to 10 
cents lower in today’s livestock market. 
Hog receipts were less than either a week 
or a year ago, encouraging commission 
men to hold out for higher prices. Efforte 
to regain all of the loss of the first two 
days in the week were not successful, how- 
ever. Good and choice 180 to 270 pound 
weights sold between $8.40 and $8.60, with 
a top at $8.60. 

Heavy cattle receipts forced sharply low-

HOUSE'S LOAN VOTE 
SENDS COTTON UP 


| . 
| Fulmer Bill’s Approval Inspires 


Broad Buying With Gains 
to Peaks for Season 


| LIST RISES 16 TO 20 POINTS 


Bombay Bids an Early Factor, 
With Wall Street and the 
Trade Joining In 


Adoption by the House of Repre- 
sentatives late on Tuesday of the 
Fulmer bill, which provides for non- 


| recourse loans on cotton at 75 per 


cent of parity, inspired buying from 
all directions in the cotton market 
yesterday. All the active deliveries 
on the New York Cotton Exchange 
ran up to new high levels for the 
season, and the close was at net 
gains of 16 to 20 points for the ses- 
sion. At their high marks of 11.59 
cents, the December and March pos 
sitions both touched the highest 
price for any month since 1937. 
Despite the action of the House, 
the ultimate form in which loan 
legislation will be enacted still is 
in doubt. Since the Administra- 
tion is believed to be opposed to 
further cash benefit payments to 
farmers directly out of the Treasury 
in view of the nation’s defense ef- 
fort, it is quite likely that the de- 
mands of the farmers for better 
prices will be satisfied through a 
higher non-recourse loan rate. 


12-Cent ‘‘Floor’’ Sensed 


The establishment of a 75 per cent 
parity loan rate would mean that 
a ‘floor’ of 12 cents a pound would 
be established under cotton. 

The response by the market was 
not immediately apparent at the 
opening when prices were up only 
3 to 5 points. However, under the 
impetus of Bombay buying and sup- 
port from the trade and Wall Street. 
prices soon began to move forwar 
rapidly. Although quotations eased 
a little near the close under the im- 
pact of profit-taking, final prices 
were only a few points, in most 
instances, from the high levels of 
the day. 

Although May was not quite so 
strong as the other months through 
most of the session, covering by 
shorts engendered a rise in the last 


| hour which carried May up to a net 


gain of 20 points, the best for any 
of the positions. 

Three notices of delivery were 
issued against May contracts, but 
they were stopped by the same spot 
firm which had taken the other 110 


notices issued. 


15-16-Middling Up in South 


The average price of 15-16-inch 
middling cotton at the ten desig- 
nated Southern markets rose to a 
new seasonal high level of 11.35 
cents, 13 points above the previous 
peak set early in April. 

The weekly report showed that 
rains and subnormal temperatures 
in many parts of the Western Belt 
have retarded the progress of the 
crop. The eastern part, however, 
experienced more favorable condi+ 
tions and it was reported that chope 
ping was well advanced in several 
Eastern States. 

The Commodity Credit Corpora~ 
tion announced that withdrawals 
from the 1940 loan stock through 
April 26 amounted to 1,316,486 bales, 
leaving a net stock of 1,839,559 as 
of that date. 

Certificated stocks were increased 
by an additional 972 bales to a total 


of 18,451.

New Wheat Crop 


WASHINGTON, April 30 (—The 
possibility of a shortage of storage 
|}space for the new wheat crop is 
leading the Department of Agricul- 
ture to arrange for movement of 


upward of 80,000,000 bushels of gove 
ernment-owned grain frora the Mid- 
west and Southwest into eastern 
and gulf terminals. 

Officials said possibly 25,000,000 
bushels would be shipped to Burfalo 
and Baltimore and 15,000,000 or 


more to Galveston and New Orleans 
from points in Texas, Oklahoma, 
Kansas and Nebraska. Another 
40,000,000 bushels, they said, may be 
moved later from the Spring wheat 
States of North Dakota, South 
Dakota, Minnesota and Montana, 


into Chicago and eastern storage. 


The storage problem has been 
complicated by the accumulation of 
huge surpluses of wheat and corn. 
Department plans for controlling 
the flow of grain from the farm to 
market so as to avoid traffic con- 
gestion and storage difficulties are 
being made at a series of meetings 
with representatives of the grain 
trade, the railroads and the truck+ 
ing industry. The first meeting was 
held today at Amarillo, Texas, 
Other meetings are scheduled for 
May 2 at Enid, Okla., and May % 
at Kansas City, Mo. Officiais 
said other meetings would be held 


further north as the harvesting sea- 
son advances. 





Southern Pacific Repays RFC 

The Southern Pacific Company 
has repaid $5,000,000 of $10,000,000 
lent by the Reconstruction Finance 
Corporation and due on May 1 next, 
The remainder has been consol 
dated with a loan of $8,000,000 by 
the goverment extended to May 
1, 1945.

WASHINGTON, April 30—Sales of 
wholesalers during March were 26 
per cent ahead of the corresponding 
month last year, the Census Bureau 
reported today. This gain was the 
second largest over the year before 
recorded by the study since it was 
begun in 1936. The gain in March 
is greater than the increase in Jan- 
uary and February and lifted the 
increase for the first quarter of the 
year to 21 per cent

Advertising News and Notes 


Some British companies 
have financial reserves are wrest- 
ling with the problem of whether to 
continue advertising or turn over 
these reserves to the government 
for the manufacture of planes, 
Michael Stiver of the London office 
J. Walter Thompson Company 
here yesterday. He returned 
from London last week. 

He said that one food company, 
whose sales spurted sharply was 
still debating whether to plunge a 
large reserve fund into advertising 
or take 10 per cent of it for small 
copy to announce that it has turned 
its advertising funds over to the 
government. Some companies whose 
production has been curtailed sharp- 
ly have abandoned advertising, Mr. 
Stiver said, while others in similar 
circumstances have continued it. 

Mr. Stiver remarked that British 
newspapers in which space is at a 
premium, certain desirable positions 
having increased 30 per cent in cost, 
are becoming more * about 
some patent medicine lines and are 
ethical com-

ABC to Test Newspaper Plan 

The Audit Bureau of Circulation 
wil] test out the plan to visualize 
newspaper circulation, it was an- 
nounced yesterday. The bureau’s 
special newspaper committee sub- 
mitted a report on the proposal to 
the board’s committee on the plan, 
which in turn recommended that | 
the management apply the proposed 
plan to a number of actual tests 
and report the results. Under the 
proposal, newspaper circulation 
would be visualized through the 
use of maps,

|FURNITURE PROFITS — NYLON HOSIERY PUT 


LOWER IN BIG STORES 


But They Had Sadler Costs for | 
Time Selling | 


The percentage of net profit of 
large retail furniture stores in 1940 
was considerably lower than that| 


for medium-sized and small stores, | 
| although the net direct time selling 


cost was much less for the large 
stores, according to the annual re- 
port of the contro] and management 
division of the National Retail Fur- 
niture Association which was re- 
leased yesterday. 

Stores with a sales volume greater 
than $350,000 were classified as)| 
large stores, while those with less 
than $125,000 were listed as small. 

On a percentage basis, large stores 
did a smaller cash business than | 
those in the lower brackets, and a} 
larger percentage of their gross | 
sales resulted in returns and allow- 
ances. 


centages for medium and 
stores were 24.9 per cent and 24 per 
cent, respectively.

Constantine RevisesDownward 
Earlier Estimates on '41 
Shipments to Stores 





Nylon hosiery will represent 17 to 
20 per cent of shipments of full- 
fashioned hosiery to retailers this 
year, it was estimated yesterday by 
Earl Constantine, president of the 
National Association of Hosiery 
Manufacturers, in a talk at a meet- 
wares group of the National Retail 
Dry Goods Association at the Hotel | 
Governor Clinton. Mr. Constantine’s 
figures were somewhat under ear- 
|lier estimates which ranged from 20 
to 25 per cent. 

Edward J. Brown, divisional mer- 
chandise manager of Arnold Con- 
stable & Co., presided at the meet- 
ing of the accessory and small 
ing, which was almost entirely 
given over to discussion of the 
|nylon situation. 

Expressing the belief that the 
figures on nylon hosiery shipments 
|for April, when they are available, 
| will be fairly typical of the re- 
mainder of the year, Mr, Constan- 
tine said that shipments in March 
|comprised 572,928 dozen pairs; in 
| February, 468,227 dozen pairs, and 
in January, 394,254 dozen pairs. 

Thus, for the first quarter, he 
reported total shipments of 10,295,- 
825 dozen pairs of women’s full- 
| fashioned hosiery. Nylon represent- 
|}ed 14 per cent, or 1,435,006 dozen 
pairs, with all other types of full- 
| fashioned hosiery totaling 8,860,000 
dozen pairs. 
| Telling of the results of a ques-| 
tionnaire on returns sent to manu- 
facturers, Mr. Constantine said 
most of the producers would con- 
sider returns on the basis of manu- 
|facturing defects. However, the 
tendency of nylon hosiery to snag 
was mentioned and the point was 
made that the hosiery manufactur- 
er does not consider a run traced 
|to a snag as a fair basis for returns. 
| Giving a ‘‘layman’s’’ opinion on 
|the durability of nylon hosiery, Mr. 
Constantine put it about two to one 
as compared with silk. 

Touching on reports that 42-45 
gauge machines were on the way 
out, Mr. Constantine expressed 
doubt that this would happen for 
at least two years more. Hosiery 
of this gauge, he said, appeals to 
|the pocketbook of the vast bulk of 
women who buy full-fashioned ho- 
siery. In addition, he declared, 
considerable difficulty is likely to 
be encountered in obtaining the 
finer 45-51 gauge machines because 
of the concentration of the ma- 
| chinery industry upon national de- 





| fense.

SHEET SHORTAGE UP 
AT TEXTILE PARLEY 


Acute Situation on Single-Bed | 
Sizes to Be Discussed at 
Commerce Dept. Session 





PRICES ALSO ON AGENDA 


And Collection of Inventory 
Data by OPM Is Expected 
to Be Debated 


Shortages of sheets in single-bed 
sizes, the difficulty of keeping 
prices down in the face of unusually 
heavy defense calls on certain tex- 
tile equipment, and the question of 
collection of inventory statistics by 
the OPM or by its authority will 
be among problems discussed at to- 
morrow’s round-table on textiles to | 
be held as a part of the conference 
of consumer-goods industries at 
Washington called by the Depart- 
ment of Commerce, it was indicated | 
yesterday. 

The sheet situation was described | 
acute. One of the leading pro-- 
ducers of branded lines was re- 
ported to be sold solidly through 
the third quarter. Many producers 
are still offering July-September 
goods in limited quantities and in 
broken assortments, with th: break 
usually occurring in the case of 63- 
inch and 72-inch goods. Worth 
Street estimates put the total pur- 
chases of sheets since last July at | 
between 12,000,000 and 13,000,000 
units, and while it has been indi- 
cated that the ‘‘hump”’ in defense 
buying is over, mills have not been 
given any assurance that no fur- 
ther purchases will be made 

Some selling agents said the last 
purchase by the Army was made} 
virtually as a requisition. Mills were 
given to understand that failure to 
provide the wanted quantities would 
lead either to priorities or outright 
taking over by the government of 
the productive facilities. 

Defense buying of single-bed 
sheets was out of all proportion to 
the normal relation of single sizes 
to double sizes, and the result has 
been that many milis are now mak- 
ing narrow sheets on wide looms. 
This, of course, has resulted in cost 
increases, and in some instances 
negotiated contracts have been 
made at prices to the Army higher 
than the same mills have charged 
to wholesalers, since the Army was 
willing to pay the added cost of 
switching wide looms to narrow 
goods. 

Government purchases, although 
large, have taken no more than the 
surplus capacity of the industry 
over a normal year, selling agents 
said, but added that this has been 
no normal year. January sales were 
unusually successful, and retailers 
have enjoyed good business on 
sheets ever since, without the usual 
February-April letdown. Indicative 
of public demand for sheets was the 
experience of one store whose re- 
sponse to private sales in advance 
of regular advertised May sales has 
been 300 per cent ahead of last year. 

No agreement is likely among tex- 
tile men on the question of inven- 
tory statistics, it was indicated. 
Some selling agents opposed such 
figures because they believed that | 
data on normal Spring accumula- 
tions of good to be sold in the Fall 
might be used by buyers to bear 
down the market in normal years. 
Others believed that inventory sta- 
tistics from both producers and 
their customers would prevent the 
panicky buying that leads to rapidly 
rising prices.

Price Rises Develop on Men’s Furnishings; 


Gloves Up 25c to $2; Other Advances Due 


Price advances on men’s furnish- 
ings developed or were threatened 
yesterday in several cases. Final 
increases on glove prices came 


through, while additional rises on 
shirts and robes were predicted. 
Unlined gloves were moved up 25 
cents to $1.50 a dozen, while lined 
numbers were advanced 75 cents to 
$2 a dozen. Lined capeskins and 
suedes, formerly selling at $10.50 a 
dozen, were boosted to $11.25, while 
numbers previously quoted at $15 
were raised to $16 and $17 a dozen. 
Unbranded shirts, now coming out 
for Fall, were generally quoted at 
prevailing Spring levels. But the 
industry was discussing a possible 
price advance of 40 cents a dozen, 
which might result from new wage

Scotch Rise Hinges on Stocks 

Retail advances on Scotch whisky 
prices will depend on how quickly 
current stocks here are depleted, 
wholesalers said yesterday. They 
vary with individual brands, but on 
the average are considerably below 
normal. In recent months ship- 
ments have been erratic, sometimes 
as late as two to three months. In 
one or two instances importers 
were completely out of stock for 
short periods.

Women’s Shoe Rise Forecast 
Prices of some lines of women’s 
shoes, especially in the volume 
ranges, are likely to move higher 
when showings are held later this 
month, according to trade comment 
yesterday. Manufacturers were 
said to be squeezed between rising 
raw material costs and retailers’ de- 
sire to maintain fixed retail selling 
ranges and normal mark-ups. It 
was said that manufacturers were 
likely to sound out buyers at the 
May showings in the hope of get- 
ting advances through and they 
were counting upon the steady vol- 
ume of Summer orders already 
booked to strengthen their position.

,; minimums, effective Sept. 1. The 
| Manhattan Shirt Company yester- 
| day announced unchanged prices on 
its Fall lines. Cluett, Peabody & 
Co. had previously made a similar 
announcement. 

Heavy orders have been placed for | 
wool robes in the last week and 
buyers suspect that manufacturers 
have booked more orders than they 
can deliver. Piece goods are scarce 
and the current range of prices, 
| $3.87% to $4, for the basic wool 
flannel robe is not expected to last 
very long. 

Half hose has been advanced in 
price. Mercerized yarn goods are| 
up 10 cents a dozen and wools for 
Fall have been lifted 10 to 25 cents 
a dozen.

were only 17 per cent above the cor-| 
responding month of last year.

Fiber Rug Deliveries Tighter 
With reorders on fiber and sisal 
rugs coming in faster than mills are 
able to produce them, deliveries 
have been pushed ahead to about 
three weeks and may grow longer, 
|} manufacturers reported yesterday. 
| As a rule, stores begin to close out 
| their stocks around the end of June 
and cancel any unfilled orders at | 
that time. This year, however, man- 
ufacturers believe the season will 
be extended and even see a possi- 
bility that their year-round business 
may be increased as a result of} 
higher prices and even later deliv-| 
eries in wool-floor coverings.

Ship Rumor Advances Burlap | 

Rumors that additional boats 
would go on the burlap run to the 
United States have caused advances 
of nearly % cent a yard in Calcutta 
burlap prices in the last two days, 
| but traders here have not followed 
the advance. Domestic sellers are 
not anxious to take more business 
from many of their accounts be- 
cause of strained credit lines. Buy- 
| ers showed no interest in futures at 
| the higher prices. C. E. Rockstroh 
& Co. quoted 40-inch burlap yester- | 
day nominally as follows: 
| 8-Ounce. 101, 
Spot and afloat 9.60

quarter. Prices were generally 
steady, but the values of individual 
delivery positions moved upward. 
Spots were at the basis of 9% cents 
for 39-inch 80x80s, 8% cents for 39- 
inch 68x72s, 7% cents for 38%-inch 
64x60s and 6%4 cents for 38%4-inch 60x

plied through May. Broadcloths

Majority May Be in Favor 
of Acting on Suggestion 


Special to THe New YorK TIMEs, 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Repre- 
sentative Harry Sauthoff of Wis- 
consin, proposed today that the gov- 
ernment print ‘‘tax stamps’’ in 
denominations of $1, $3 and $5, 
which would be sold through post- 
offices. 
them in on March 15 in lieu of cash. 


Expressions indicating that a 
large number of the House Ways 
and Means Committee favored such 
an ‘‘easy payment”’ plan for in- 
creased income taxes were heard 
after Mr. Sauthoff had laid his pro- 
posal before them. 

“This is a benefit to the taxpayer 
because it does not burden him with 
a lump-sum payment,’’ Mr. Saut- 
hoff told the committee, which is 
considering a measure to raise an 
additional $3,500,000,000 to help pay 
for the defense program. 

“Tt is also a benefit to him be- 
cause he will save a little as he 
goes along. To the government it 
will be an advantage because there 
will be revenue flowing in steadily 
throughout the year, and it also will 
be an advantage in that the tax 
will be collected, which in some 
cases otherwise might not be col- 
lected.’’ 


Lack of Savings a Problem 


Mr. Sauthoff remarked that many 
thousands of persons who will be 
called upon to pay an income tax, 
perhaps for the first time under any 
schedule of ‘lowered exemptions, 
have no bank or savings accounts. 

‘Substantial taxes’’ were proposed 
iby The Wisconsin Progressive for 
|radio- broadcasting stations. He 
asked that second class mail be put 
on a “‘paying basis.’’ 

Chairman Doughton informed Mr. 
Sauthoff that the committee had di- 
rected the Joint Committee on In- 
ternal Revenue Taxation to make a 
study of the radio broadcasting tax. 
Estimates vary widely on what it 


would bring in, but the amount was | 


said to be substantial. 
Mr, 
ond class mail would exempt from 
increases newspapers of less than 
10,000 circulation. 

Chairman Doughton announced 
that Leon Henderson, Director of 


the Office of Price Administration |

| Excess Profits Plan Due Tomorrow 
By The Associated Press. 


WASHINGTON, April 30—John L. 


| Treasury, 
submit to the Ways 
Committee Friday the 
| plan for revising the excess profits 
| tax. 

Lawrence A. Baker of Washing- 
ton, D. C., representing the Na- 
| tional Association of Life Under- 
writers, asked the committee today 
to continue the present estate tax 
exemption at $40,000, instead of low- 
|ering it to $25,000 as the Treasury 
has proposed. Mr. Baker said that 
| $40,000 invested would yield about | 
$100 a month, which, he remarked, 
was ‘‘all too little’’ for a man to 
leave his family. 


By The United Press 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Lester 
P. Barlow of Stamford, Conn., 
asked the Ways and Means Com- 
mittee today to revise tax laws so 
that inventors will receive the same 
treatment as those who are paid 
for personal services. Mr. Barlow | 
won a $600.000 judgment against | 
the government for a bomb devel- | 
|oped and used during the World | 
War. Some $300,000 of the judg- 
ment has been paid to him. Under 
current law, it is taxable in one 
year. This places the tax liability 
in the higher bracket, subject to 
| heavier taxes. 

Mr. Barlow asked that in such 
cases, the tax liability be no more | 
than if the income had been spread 
out over the period of years during | 
which the invention was being de- 
| veloped. 

Miss Agnes M. Jenks, New York, 
speaking for herself and ‘‘the mid- | 
dle classes,’’ advocated a general 
sales tax as a ‘‘sensible and reason- 
able’ levy. 

“That's why it isn’t in the bill 
—because nobody wants to have 
anything to do with anything that 
is sensible and reasonable, so far 
as I can find out,’’ she said. 


Air Traffic Up 26.9% 
Special to THe NEW YorK TIMES, 
CHICAGO, April 30— Revenue | 
passenger miles flown during the 
first quarter of 1941 by domestic 
airlines amounting to 230,077,542 
were 26.86 per cent over those| 
flown during the first three months 
of last year, Colonel Edgar S. Gor- 
rell, president of Air Transport As- 
|sociation of America, announced 
today.

MORE TELEPHONES 
MOVED IN THE CITY 


‘Spring Transfers Reach 11,900 
for Five Boroughs 





Transfers of telephones from one 
| address to another within the city 
during the Spring moving period 
from April 15 to May 15 will involve 
many more changes than were re- 
| corded during the same period last 


| year, the New York Telephone 
Company reported yesterday. The 
upturn was taken as an indication 
that business transfers, particularly 
those involving expansion due to 
defense work, are running heavier 
than for the Spring of 1940. 

The company expects to move 11,- 
900 telephones from one place to 
another within the city during this 
peak of the Spring moving period, 
|as compared with 10,692 transfers 
| during the comparable period of 
last year. The figures are exclu- 
sive of thousands of connections or 
disconnections for those moving 
seasonally into or out of the city. 

In Manhattan the estimate is 5,900, 
or about 600 more than last Spring, 
and for the other boroughs the fig- 


iures are Brooklyn, 2,500; Queens,

| this period these orders are expect- 
ed to reach 32,267, against 31,843 for 
the same days last year. In Brook- 
lyn (electric meters only) and 
Queens the combined figure is 
31,419, slightly lower than the total 
of 32,719 for the same days in 1940.

another new man, I. B., with us since Feb. 
21. drew $73.23 for the week; E. 8., with 
only 3 months’ experience in this appliance 
business, $92.53 for the week; F. B. G. Jr., 
with us over 3 years, $284.68 for the week; 
A $156.27; W. G., former shipping

ALBANY, April 30 G)—New York 
closed its tinder-dry forests to the|

| 


| were thrown into the battle in an | 


|er Bureau at 7:30 o'clock 








public today, apprehensive of addi- | 


tional destruction from fires which 
already have burned about 25,000 
acres at an estimated $60,000 loss. 
Weather Bureau observers sighted | 
no immediate relief from weeks of 
warm, rainless days. and Conserva- 


tion Department officials termed 


the fire danger ‘probably the most 


hd 

serious in history of the State. 
Governor Lehman issued a procla- 
mation a little after noon closing 
the woodlands at the request of 
William G. Howard, Director of 
Lands and Forests, as a hot sun, 
brisk winds and relatively low hu-| 


midity continued. He said New 
York has had no rainfall of any 
value since April 5. 

As the Governor issued his order, 
effective until he revokes it, hun- 
dreds of volunteers, Conservation 
Department fire fighters and fire- 
men of a half dozen communities 
battled to keep under control two| 
huge blazes in the Adirondack | 
Mountains which had destroyed 
about 8,000 acres in Clinton and 
Essex Counties. 

These fires, divided by the Ausable 
River and extending five to six 
miles in length and two miles in 
width, developed from six separate 
blazes which started late yesterday. 
The were brought under control at} 
dawn, but continued to burn. 

Thirteen fires were reported in the 
Catskill Mountain region, as well as 
nine in Westchester, Putnam, Co- 
lumbia and Rensselaer Counties | 
east of the Hudson River, eight in| 
Suffolk County and nine in south-| 
ern New York. In addition, scat-| 
tered blazes broke out in the St. 
Lawrence River and Finger Lakes 
regions and in western New York. 

The Governor’s order declares 
that use of the woods for recreation | 
or sport of any kind “‘is contrary 
to public interests,’’ and forbids | 
‘‘any person or persons entering 
forests, woodlands or open lands in| 
any part of the State for any pur-| 
pose except that of necessary busi- 
ness.”” 

It suspends all open seasons for 
taking of fish, birds or quadrupeds, 
excepting only commercial fisheries | 
and angling from boats on lakes or | 
ponds accessible to public automo- 
bile roads. 

On the alert for fire are ninety | 
observers in fire towers throughout 
the State, the Conservation Depart- 
ment’s airplane pilot, Fred McLane, | 
and ninety rangers and 2,600 fire 
wardens equipped with portable 
radios. State Police are aiding in| 
rounding up volunteers to fight the 
flames.

At Upton, Me., hundreds of fire- 


fighters sought to control a blaze 


sweeping southeastward toward the 
town of Andover. Another Maine 
fire, at Fryeburg, was checked 
after burning 1,000,000 feet of 
stacked lumber. 

Two families were made homeless 
and the town records in Sebago, 
Me., were destroyed before firemen 


brought a blaze under control at) 


Sebago Center. 

A fire originating near Marlow, 
N. H., jumped 100 yards across Hi- 
land Lake at Stoddard and edged 


The | 





toward the little towns of Hancock | 


and Washington. Fourteen cottages 
along the lake front were burned. 

The fire was approximately as 
large in area as one which burned 
over 100 or more square miles en- 
compassing the rural parts of Dun- 
stable, Westford, Groton and Force 
Village in Massachusetts. 

A fire at Stoddard, N. H., was re- 
ported moving in two directions, 
toward Hillsboro and Windsor and 
toward Washington. 

Two other fires were reported at 


Pistarin Mountain, in Spofford, 
N. H., and another in the towns of 
Hancock and Harrisville. 
Half of the twenty-two towns in 
Cheshire County, N. H., were fight-

A shallow trough of low pressure 
that was over and off New England 


} Tuesday night was displaced south- 


ward by rising pressure, 1,014 milli- 
bars (29.95 inches) at Hartford and 
New York, while the Western low 
pressure system persisted with cen- 
ters continuing over the northern 
plateau and the extreme Southwest. 


The ridge of high pressure that 


has been drifting slowly southeast 


from the Lakes region became ill 
defined, but persisted as far west 
as the Mississippi Valley. Another 
ridge was over and north of the 
Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence Val-

for that purpose drafted by the 
legislative committees on national

and civilian salaries, the Legislature 
having rejected a recommendation | 
by the Governor that this be done. 

Another Civil Service measure |

type of male nucleus. Again there 
were differences in the development 
of the embryos. Since in this case 
the female cytoplasm was the sole 
variable factor, the differences in 
this set of experiments could be at- 


tributed to the cytoplasm. In this 
manner the technique permits for 
the first time to study the separate 
contributions made by the nucleus

| ‘The accumulated evidence from| «J+ ean be concluded,” Dr.

Porter declared, ‘‘makes acceptable | factors which

sult of a cooperation between the | frogs) show differences, and that

or what characteristics of the one 

decide how the other will act.”’ 

In his experiments Dr. Porter 

used the eggs and sperms of four 

types of frogs collected from dif-| 

ferent geographic regions, North- 

ern Vermont, Southeastern Penn- 

sylvania, Louisiana and Southern 

Florida. He then made a number 

of combinations between the female 

cytoplasm and male nucleus of the 
| different species to determine what 

role the cytoplasm and nucleus 
| played in embryonic development. 
For example, he fertilized four 
|eggs from Northern Vermont with 
| the male sperm of the four varieties 
of frogs and then removed the 
female nucleus, thus producing a 
combination of one type of cy- 
toplasm fertilized, respectively, by 
four different types of male nucleus, 
so that the male element was the 
only variable factor. He obtained 
four different types of embryos, 
thus showing what effect the nuclei 
contributed to the development. 

He then reversed the experiment, | 
— four different types of cyto- 


non-cancerous strains of mice by | 
|Dr. Clarence C. Little, at the Jack- 
|son Memorial Laboratories at Bar 
Harbor, Me., provided puzzling re- 
sults that indicated that there were 
| extra-chromosomal factors, namely, 
| factors within the cytoplasm, that 
played a part in the hereditary 
transmission of susceptibility to 
|}eancer in mice. Dr. Porter’s work 
provides the first direct evidence 
that such is indeed the case.

Composed of Cells 


All living things, plants and ani- 
mals, are composed of units, or 


| cells. 


The cells known as the germ 
the egg of the female and the 


differ in one 


the cells in the body. Instead of 
possessing a complete number of 
| chromosomes, the male and female 
|germ cells contain only half the 
normal count, so that when the two 
germ cells unite through the proc- 
ess of fertilization the two halves 
form one whole cell with a full 
quota of chromosomes and genes, 
half from the male and the other 
half from the female. 

Since all the genes are contained 
in the nucleus it had been taken for 
granted by 
years that the cytoplasm of the cell 


|had no influence whatever on the 


hereditary characters of the off- 
spring.
