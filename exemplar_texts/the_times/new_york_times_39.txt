BUCHAREST, Rumania, April 
29.—The Rumanian Government to- 
day announced that it was willing 
to begin part payment of its debt | 
to the United States Government 
and to private American bondhold- 
ers. The communiqué stated: 

The Rumanian Government has 
notified the United States Gov- 
ernment that it has decided to 
submit an arrangement for pay- 
ing its war debt to America. 

It was also decided that on the 
basis of the arrangement between 
the Rumanian Minister in Wash- 
and the association of 
holders of Rumanian 
post-war bonds placed in the 
United States, regular payment 
on this public debt should begin 
within the framework either of 
the present transfer possibilities 
or those that are createc through 
the development of economic re- 
lations between Rumania and the 
United States. 

The American Minister, Franklin |

ence this morning with Premier 
Armand Calinescu and officials of 
the Ministries of Finance and Com-

SUNDAY, APRIL 


City Sales | Tax Monthly 


Night clubs and cabarets will be 
compelled to pay the city their 
sales tax receipts every month, 
beginning May 20, instead of quar 
terly, because too many have fall 
en in arrears and others have not 
paid at all, Controller Joseph D. 
McGoldrick announced yesterday. 

“Numerous fly-by-night caba- 
rets have been able to avoid any 
tax whatsoever by the simple 
process of going out of business, 
and despite the fact that patrons 
have paid the tax to the clubs the 
city has never received it,’’ the 
Controller said “Tax evasion 
will be practically impossible un- 
der the new system. Needless to 
say, we have never had trouble 
with the more reputable luxury 
restaurants and clubs.”

No Mayor, he said, should stand 
in the way of the progress that 
must be made by the school system 
The school warned, 
should be the last institution ‘‘to be 


curtailed in the smallest way by the 
economy necessary in these days.’’ 

Evidently believing that Colonel 
Carlin would not be reappointed, 
Mr. O’Brien, after praising the 
Brooklyn member, declared: 

‘He has finished a career on the 
board that is remarkable in every 
respect.’’ 

Declaring that he was inspired by 
reading the record of achievements 
made by Colonel Carlin, Mr. Poletti 
added that ‘‘we need more citizens

Demanding that the schools teach 
loyalty to American traditions, 
Dean White urged the teachers to 
help in abandoning ‘‘the peace 
strikes, the treasonable Oxford 
oaths not to bear arms in any war, 
and the appeals made to class hate 
which would destroy the unity of 
our people.’’

Two textbooks used in the public

for recommending that

In a speech at the annual educa-

Union in the Hotel Astor, Mr. Kern 
asserted that even a syllabus of the

upon the La Guardia administra-

that Mr. Prial had used ‘‘whatever

GREENWICH 


presents 


Prints inspired by America’s colorful history 


Fashions designed for present-day American life 


American history brought to life—and dramatized in vivid, fun- 


to-wear clothes! 


We went way back to 1816 for them—to 


the year when “The George Washington Print Works were 
founded at the Falls of the Schuylkill in Philadelphia. That was 
the birth- place of the now-famous Everfast Mills, and early 


this year we discovered there,a treasure-trove of crumbling, calf- 


bound volumes filled with samples of antique printed fabrics. 


Borrowing bodily four of the gayest ones that colorfully record 


the years from 1843 to 1860, we flew back to New York and 


had them designed in new, exciting, world-of-tomorrow clothes. 


Made them in Everfast fabrics, blessedly fast to sun and washing, 


completely crease-resistant. Beaming with patriotic pride, we ve 


called them “The American Way” 


, after the play now at the 


Center Theatre. And we present them on this, the opening day 


of the New York World's Fair a date which commemorates the 


150th anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington.

‘RECOVERY’ LAWS 


Labor, 
SEC, Currency, Social Security 
Are Called Essential 


Revisions on Taxes, 


FEDERAL ECONOMY ASKED 


Government's Best-Intentioned 
Plans Have Failed, Manufac- 
turers Association Says 


Special to THe New York Times 
WASHINGTON, April 29.—Pro 
posals for ‘‘recovery"’ 
fields of taxca, labor legislation, in 
dustrial financing, currency and so 


action in the 


cial security were made today by 
the National Association of Manu 
facturers 

The association stated that its 
were made “in 
the belief that the best-intentioned 
efforts of the government have 
failed to produce the expected re 
covery as evidenced by business 
levels.”’ 


recommendations 


With regard to social security, the 
association asserted that it ‘‘whole 
heartedly approves’’ the decision of 
the House Ways and Means Com 
mittee to freeze the old-age benefit 
levy at 1 per cent for a three-year 
period stating that its actuarial 
indicated 
contributions would be sufficient to 
provide annuities set by the present 
act until 1971 

“Definite encouragement would 
be provided to business confidence 
if government economy were prac 
ticed on a sufficient scale to indi 
cate that definite steps were under 
way for balancing of the Federal 
budget in the relatively near fu- 
ture,’’ according to the associa- 
tion’s statement 

The statement expressed the be- 
lief that ‘‘the ordinary expenditures 
of government could be reduced by 


studie that present joint 


at least 20 per cent,”’ 
further that ‘‘the Secretary of the 
Treasury is on record as believing 
feasible economies which would 
total $700,000,000."’ 

The program renews seven spe 
cific proposals for revision of the 
Wagner Act, stating industry’s be- 
lief that ‘‘the largely one-sided and 
biased administration of the act 
creating confusior cau 
trial disputes and injuring employ 
es, employers and the public alike.”’ 
It is asserted that ‘‘men can't 
work when capital isn't working.’’ 

The association urges ‘‘construc 
tive amendment” of the Securities 
Act of 1933 and the 1934 Securites 
Exchange Act to give the following 
results 

1 To reduce the expense of 
creating and distributing new cap- 
ital issues by private business 

2. To reduce the length of time 
now involved in creating and dis- 
tributing such new capital issues 

3. To reduce and clarify the lia 
bilities incurred in the creation and 
distribution of new 


sing indus 


capital issues 
by private busines 

“We believe that this government 
could now do things which 
unsettled foreign conditions, would 
definitely facilitate the attainment 
of the goal of a definite and de- 
standard,’’ the 
“Specifically, we 
make the following proposals 

“1. The stabilization fund should 
be retained as long as world eco- 
nomic conditions continue in their 
present unsettled state 

“2. The executive department of 
the government should have the 
power to declare a temporary em 
bargo on the import or export of 
gold 

“3. The Pres

dent's power to or

is a factor of 
importance in Maintaining 
uncertainty about our currency. 

‘4. The discretionary power of 
the President to change the value 
of the dollar should be repealed 

5. The Silver Purchase Act 
should be repealed 

“6. Steps should be taken which 
would definitely indicate both the 
intent and the ability to balance the 
Federal budget at a reasonably 
early date by reduction of govern- 
ment expenditures.’’

Members of the Senate Appropri 
ations Committee said it was possi- 
ble that provisions covering con 
ributions and relief distribution 
would be written into the WPA Ap 
propriation Bill for the fiscal year 
beginning July 1 
The President has asked $1,750,- 
000,00 for work relief and related 
activities Action on the request 
probabily will be delayed until the 
House Appropriations Committee 
has had time to analyze results of 
current investigation of the 
» committee will resume hear- 
Monday with an inquiry into 
*"A arts and construction projects 
New York cities 
President Roosevelt's failure to 
equest an additional public works 
ippropriation in his relief message 
brought demands in the Senate to 
day for a $500,000,000 PWA allot- 
ment 


Mead Will Seek Fund 


Senator Mead, New York Demo- 
crat, said he would seek to attach 
such an appropriation to the relief 
bill. He pointed out that many 


cities and counties had conducted 
elections authorizing public-works 
projects subject to grants and loans 
by the PWA and declared that the 
appropriation he proposed should 
be confined to projects already ap- 
proved by the PWA. Senator 
Schwellenbach, Washington Demo- 
crat, also favored a further PWA 
appropriation 
A good many communities went 
to the expense of hiring engineers 
and holding elections after they had 
been assured by the government 
they would get the loans and 
nt he a serted Now they 
uturally feel that they are entitled 
the money 
In his first government reorgani 
zation plan, submitted to Congress 
this week, the President placed the 
PWA under a new Federal works 
agency, but Senator Mead pointed 
out that Congress still could ear- 
mark funds for the PWA The 
agency is not scheduled to expire 
until June 30, 1941 
One member of the Senate Ap- 
propriations Committee disclosed 
that an effort was being made by 
yme Senators to unify urban and 
rural support behind a new public 
works program and an expanded 
farm program 
Some Senators have been seeking 
» add $400,000,000 for farm benefits 
to the Agriculture Department Ap 
propriation Bill If the Appropria- 
tions Committee approves this sum, 
t was reported, then these Senators 
might go along with the PWA pro-

THE 


TO TAX ENACTMENT 


State Sales Levy for Relief 
to Go to Assembly Floor 
With Strong Backing 


INCREASE ON LIQUOR DUE 


Two Cents on Cigarettes Will 
Be Voted and Emergency 
Imposts Continued 


By WARREN MOSCOW 
Special to THE 
ALBANY, April 29 
posed temporarily of the budget 
problem, the attention of the State 
Legislature will be turned this week 
toward enactment of the necessary 
taxes to finance the new budget 
and also discussion of the sales tax 
and housing problems. 

The sales tax, as previously re- 
ported, is scheduled to be reported 
out of committee in the Assembly, 
in accordance with a commitment 
made by the legislative leaders to 
the powerful 
litical leaders who are seeking its 
enactment 

This group, which consists of 
Mayor Marvin of Syracuse, Thomas 
B. Broderick of Rochester, Russell 
Sprague of Nassau and William F. 
Blakely of Westchester, has con- 
tinued to press for the enactment 
of the tax, so that the burden of 
financing home relief will be taken 
over entirely by the State 

New York City’s relief problem 
appears to hinge also on the sales 
tax, as Mayor La Guardia has as 
vet 
the re-enactment by the Legislature 
of the emergency taxes which the 
city is now using for relief purposes. 
Nor has he made any public protest

NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 


over the adoption by the Republican 
Legislature of a State-wide cigarette 
tax, which would interfere with the 
cigarette tax now imposed by New 
fork City. 

Housing Legislation Expected 


The legislative have de- 
layed bringing up the housing ques 
tion until after the budget was 
passed by both houses, which was 
done yesterday. All indications now 
point to the enactment of a housing 
bill with a small allocation from 
the $300,000,000 bond issue approved 
last Fall, and also only a fraction 
of the million-dollar-per-year sub- 
}sidy which is permitted under the 
new constitution. 

The proposed increase in the 
liquor tax, effective on May 1, is 
| scheduled to be voted and signed by 
Governor Lehman, as he suggested 
that tax as one of three to help bal- 
ance his $415,000,000 budget 
| Then will come the 2 
|} package cigarette tax, and 
enactment of all the emergency 
levies, such as the third and fourth 
cent. of the gasoline tax and the 1 
per cent gross income tax, which 
are all part of the State fiscal pro 
gram, 

The reason that the disposition 
of the budget problem is considered 
only temporary is that there are 
two possibilities which can throw 
the budget back into the laps of the 
legislators. First is that Governor 
Leh.nan may veto it as unconstitu- 
tional because of the lump-sum ap- 
propriations made by the Republi- 
cans in the place of his line-item 
budget. This step would leave the 
State without any budget at all, as 
there is no sign that the Republi 
cans intend to recede from their 
stand 

The second possibility is 
with the budget headed for a 
|stitutional test in the courts, 
| through a procedure not yet set- 
tled, .an adverse court decision 
might invalidate the $7,000,000 of 
cuts the Republicans made in the 
State Departmental appropriations, 
by the lump-sum method. 

The Governor is expected to study 
his course of action, and confer 
| with his legal advisers, this week.

In a resolution adopted at a meet-

The board said the reductions 
would ‘“‘not needlessly curtail’’ es-

‘The burden will be placed upon 
State departments to reduce their 
expenditures and to terminate their

NAWOONE 





THE STARS AND STRIPES, dipping and flaring against the sky, is today a vibrant symbol of 
freedom in an ailing world where freedom is rapidly getting scarce. 


We who live under the lucky Stars have a multitude of things to be grateful for. Our lives 


are our own. We're free to agree or disagree. We can read the books we like. We can hear 


the music we like. We can see the plays we like. And all our camps ‘’4re recreational. 


Our homes and gardens are ours alone; and when we plant flowers this May we can be- 


lieve we'll be here in August to pluck the blooms. We are free to live, to speak our minds 


and follow our hearts. 


At no other time has “Old Glory” been to us a more beautiful symbol. We're boundlessly 


proud of it, and we feel that you — every single family — should own a flag and display it 


for all to see. Not just on July 4th, or at parades or political outings; but whenever and 


wherever the virile spirit of Americanism moves you. 


The next time you come to A&S we'd be ever so happy if you bought a flag. Buy one instead 


of something else in the store, something you don’t really need. Buy an American flag. No 


matter whether it's big or little, cotton or wool. And it doesn't matter whether you fly it from 


a pole or just wave it out of the window. But do buy a flag. 


Each year we give hundreds of flags to the Boy Scout troops in Brooklyn. Celebrating the 


opening of the World's Fair, we are now displaying 25 American flags outside the store. It 


strengthens our grip on things just to look at them. There's nothing in our whole store that 


we like to sell as much as an American flag.

closed toes are practically impossible to obtain in anything 


resembling smart footwear. But Saks Fifth Avenue has them 


just as we shall always endeavor to have not only the finest shoes 


in the world, but the shoes that fit our customer's needs. prefer-

OXALIC ACID FOUND 
TO CHECK BLEEDING 


Stopping of Hemorrhages in 
45 Seconds to 5 Minutes Is 
Reported to Biologists 


APPLIED IN 


1,000 CASES 


Coagulative Constituent of the 
Blood Tested in Hemophilia 
and in General Surgery 


By WILLIAM L. LAURENCE 
Special to Tos New i:orK TIMES. 

TORONTO, April 29.—A discovery 
that oxalic acid, widely 
removing ink stains and polishing 
copper, makes possible the 
coagulation of the blood in 
philia, the hereditary bleeding dis- 
was an 
today 


used for 


rapid 
hemo 


ease of European royalty, 


neunced and demonstrated 
before the closing session of the an 
Federation of 


nual meeting of the 


American Societies for Experimen 


tal Biology 


Oxalic acid is found in several! 


plants, particularly in rhubarb and 


spinach, and also in animal tissues 


It uw 


] is known to be present in the 


blood, but its role until now had 


not been suspected It is now re 
oxalic acid, labeled as a 
poison when sold in drug stores, 1s 
the normal constituent in the blood 
that enables it to clot in cases of 
internal or external injury 

The discovery, hailed as one of 
major importance for imedicine, not 
only in hemophilia but also in the 
field of pre-and-post-opera- 
tive surgery and in cases of un 
checked hemorrhages in general, 
which take thousands of lives every 
year, was reported by Dr. Arthur 
Steinberg and Dr William R 
Brown of the research foundation 
of the Kensington Hospital for Wo 
men in Philadelphia Their paper 
was sponsored by Professor A. C 
Ivy, the Northwestern University 
physiologist.

The

effectiveness of the treat 
was illustrated in the case of 
new-born twins who were in danger 
of bleeding to death The 
remedy, injection of the 
blood, was applied to one without 
effect while administering of the 
oxalic acid to the other stopped the 
bleeding in ten minutes The oxali« 
treatment was then given success

Another case reported was that of 
a patient from

bleeding is very dangerous. It has 
recently been found that a new 
vitamin, known as Vitamin K, 
found largely in alfalfa, will check

VITA-RAY 


BERLIN, April 


| 


29.—In anticipa- 
tion of May Day the press publishes 
today a proclamation by Dr. Robert 
Ley, Labor Front leader, calling on 


‘enjoy life 
that 


the German people to 

The 
Germans are ‘‘fanatics 
German life today is ‘“‘battle and 
joy, sacrifice and success, faith and 
obedience, devotion and work” and 
therefore fulfills the ‘will of God.’ 


It proceeds 

“Listen, you obscurantists’ in 
quarters of agitation around the 
world! National Socialism has made 
an end of the bone-softening 
trine of life negation, of the vale of 
tears on this earth, that 
vesse!] of sin, of poverty as a 
lude to a better beyond 

‘We want to live and enjoy life. 
We do not vegetate live con- 
sciously Life is more beautiful 
and more glorious than the boldest 
optimist ever hoped.”’ 

Simultaneously it was officially 
announced that the slaughtering of 
for meat would be reduced 
to 80 per cent of the volume pre- 
vailing hitherto in order to halt 
the decrease of herds already hit 
by hoof and mouth disease. And 
the Deutsche Volkswirt, the lead- 
ing economic periodical, demands 
the introduction of customers’ ra- 
tion lists for meat, similar to those 
already introduced for butter and 
coffee, in order to halt the house- 
wives’ ‘‘daily race for the preferred 
cutlets.”’ 


Meat Supply Reduced 


The reduction of the number of 


cattle for slaughter is expected to 
reduce the meat supply 7 per cent 
but this deficit, the Volkswirt says, 
can be made up by an increased 
consumption of pork, skimmed 
milk, cheese and milk preparations. 

At the same time Richard-Walther 
Darré, Reich Agriculture Minister, 
who opened an exhibition in Ham- 
burg called ‘‘The Blessings of the 
Sea’’ urged greater consumption of 
fish and whale oil products. He said 
that Germany's fishing fleet had 
doubled the fish supply since 1933

of beef in Germany today is that it 
is too fresh, therefore tough. Also 
a good part of this increase goes to 
special demands by the armed 
forces and by military formations 
which reduces the share of the 
civilian population 

At the same time it 
many against depending 
on Southeastern Europe 
the meat deficit, because 
of all countries in that 
far too small for the purpose 

Partly as a result of this food 
deficit Germany is pressing Lithu- 
ania to conclude a new trade pact 
that would direct 50 to 60 per cent 
of the Lithuanians’ agrarian ex 
ports to Germany even if it re- 
quires the modification of Lithu- 
ania’s treaties with Britain and 
other countries. Lithuania is not 
averse to increasing her trade with 
Germany because the Reich is her 
nearest market, but she fears ex- 
posing herself to political pressure 
as in the past 

Germany used to purchase 50 per 
cent of Lithuania's exports, but 
when the dispute over Meme! arose 
she declared a boycott and threw 
Lithuania into a grave economic 
crisis until the latter found other 
markets, principally Britain 

In recent years Germany has pur 
chased only about 8 per cent of 
Lithuania's exports

Reichstag session and the press to- 
day was wholly occupied in register- 
ing the foreign reaction to Chancel- 
lor Hitler's speech 

Editorial comment centers on the 
Chancellor’s duel with President 
Roosevelt. A few Nazi party news- 
papers carried such captions as 
“Hitler Unmasks Roosevelt Swin 
die’ and “Hitler Puts Roosevelt 
Hors de Combat Readers were 
assured that the world press was 
‘spellbound by the Fuehrer's 
speech."’ 

The American response is report- 
ed in many variations and the com- 
ment appearing today obviously re- 
flected partisan bias. 

Reports that Sir Nevile Hender 
son had been instructed by his gov- 
ernment to protest at the Foreign 
Office against Germany's denuncia- 
tion of the Anglo-German naval 
pact proved unfounded. Neither 
Britain nor Poland has undertaken 
formal steps in Berlin, it was 
authoritatively stated. It was inti- 
mated that Foreign Minister Joa- 
chim von Ribbentrop would not be 
“available’’ for any diplomatic 
protests arising from the termina- 
tion of the naval pact with Britain 
or the German-Polish pact. 

Chancellor Hitler and his Foreign 
Minister today entertained Premier 
Paul Teleki and ®oreign Minister 
Stephen Csaky of Hungary, who ar- 
rived for a three-day State visit 
The talks with the Hungarians will 
cover a wide range and are pri 
marily intended to bring them more 
intimately in harmony with the 
Axis powers and their political and 
economic aims

men’s Berlin visit the Voelkischer 
Beobachter savas 

“After twenty years of disap- 
pointments with the Western pow- 
ers all Southeast Europe has learned 
to engage in real politics. In Buda- 
pest, Belgrade and Bucharest the 
people know that cooperation with 
Greater Germany and the fascist 
imperium is a political necessity, 
not a danger Unfortunately 
malignant bunglers of Versailles 
wrought so much mischief in this 
sector that it will take all the clev-

erness and perspective of modern 
statesmen to remedy it.”’ 

Germany is now awaiting the 
British and Polish reaction to the 
Hitler speech in so far as it touched 
on German relations with those 
powers, Chancellor Hitler, it is re 
ported, will remain in Berlin until 
the middle of next week when he 
will leave for an extended holiday 
in Bavaria 

Meanwhile the Axis powers will 
confer over the situation created by 
the abrogation of the British naval 
pact and the Polish non-aggression 
agreement and determine their fu- 
ture policy These consultations 
reportedly amplify those that Colo- 
nel General Walther von Brau- 
chitsch, Commander in Chief of the 
German Arty, is about to begin 
with Italian staff officers in Italy. 

Berlin is putting on holiday dress 
for Monday’s Labor Day celebra- 
tions. Shop windows are decorated 
with banners, and streamers placed 
on office buildings proclaim the 
jcys of a worker in the Third Reich 
The city is settling down to a long 
week-end. 

Chancellor Hitler will speak twice 
Monday, to German youth gathered 
in the Olympic Stadium early in the 
morning and in the afternoon to 
representatives of the Workers 
Front in the lLustgarten Both 
speeches, it is reported, will be only 
of domestic interest

Il remember coming to this very 
spot twelve years ago with Joe Bel 
lanca, the airplane builder, who 
wanted to start a factory on the 
site, Well, even then the bridge 
was being talked about We claim 
no originality But credit can be 
taken for a most remarkable thing 

the speed with which the job was 
done,.”’ 

The bridge was construced in 
twenty-three months and opened 
sixty days ahead of schedule 

‘We're paying no attention to po 
litical whiners now,"’ he went on 
“They must seem very much 
ashamed of themselves when they 
look back to the time they con 
trolled the city. People accuse the 
Mayor of building for the future 
Why, bless their ignorant hearts, 
what they have do”? It 
must be irritating for them 
see public funds spent honestly 
Nothing sticking fingers aa of 
old.’ 


Battery Dispute Brought Up 


The Battery bridge 
was brought up by 
ers, including Mr. La Guardia, who

The Controller remarked that ‘‘as

noted a slight rise above ordinary 


Saturday loads, and bus lines said 
things were just about as usual, 
while there were only two ships in 
foreign service docking here yester- 
day But to listen to the airline 
spokesmen was to be persuaded 
that every one wanted to fly to 
the World of Tomorrow 

One explanation was that while 
the out-of-towner of ordinary means 
was likely to be postponing his trip 
until surer weather and his regular 
vacation, the air services catered to 
many to whom a transcontinental 
jaunt to the Fair for the gala open

The New York Central said traf

round-trip World's Fair rate on Fri-

Docking here yesterday were the 
Scanyork of the Scantic

Nerissa of the Trinidad Line. On 
board were many making a special

Bert White, director of the Amer

World's Fair Headquarters, 444

ty-eight Turks, who arrived Thurs 
day Two groups from Holland 
came Friday, as well as units from 
Switzerland and Germany. Twenty 
seven Swedes and fifteen Danes 
were in the party which came yes

iY The handling of automobile traffic 
to and from the Fair presents the 
most traffic con- 
the enterprise. Auto- 
mobilists entering the city from the 
South or West will reach Manhat 
tan by way of the Holland or Lin- 
coln Tunnels or the George Wash- 
ington Bridge and will find the Tri- 
borough Bridge the best link to the 
Queens highways leading to the 
Fair grounds. Motorists from the 
North will find the 3ronx 
Whitestone Bridge the most acces- 
sible connection. 

Nearly 3,000 policemen have been 
assigned to handle today’s traffic, 
because experience has taught the 
Police Department that many thou- 
sands of motorists will some

OPENING OF FAIR 


International Radio Hook-Up 
to Be Largest Attempted 
With 535 Transmitters 


APRIL 


6 NATIONS TO BROADCAST 


Program to Be Given in Eng- 
lish, German, French, Spanish 
and Also in Portugues 


When President R: elt opens 
the New York World's Fair today, 
his words will be broadcast and re- 
layed throughout the world 
is expected to be the largest 
international radio hook-up ever at- 
tempted 

From 2 to 83 o'clock, 525 broad- 
casters and at least fifteen interna- 
tional short-wave 


and other countries will provide air 
channels over which the opening of 
the Fair and the message of Mr 
Roosevelt will be sent to millions of 
listeners 

Australia, England, France, Fin- 
land, Iceland and the Soviet Repub 
lic have notified American radio 
men that the opening will be inter 
cepted over short-wave lengths and 
rebroadcast for listeners in 
countries 

If only per cent of the radio 
facilities of the six countries plan- 
ning to rebroadcast the program 
actually go on the air the number 
of stations outside this country and 
Canada will be seventy, according 
to an estimate by radio men. When 
added to the definitely committed 
466 American broadcasters the 
world-wide number swells to the 
grand total of 535 transmitters 
thirty-three of which are in Can- 
ada. 

Never in radio’s history has such 
a number of stations been joined 
for an event, according to available 
information. The wide interest is 
due to the world-wide scope and 
coverage of the Fair, it is pointed 
out. The Fair’s broadcast and tele- 
vision programs have been ar- 
ranged under the direction of John 
S. Young, the Fair's director of 
radio 

The same international wave- 
lengths expected to reach Hawaii, 
Australia and the Philippines will 
be available for reception in China 
Japan and New Zealand. Other lis- 
teners in South America and Eu 
rope can hear the words of Presi 
dent Roosevelt through a recording 
to be carried over NBC short-wave 
transmitters at Bound Brook, N. J., 
and Pittsburgh from 10:15 to 11 
P. M. tonight The program will 
go out in English, together with 
translations in German, French, 
| Portuguese and Spanish. In addi- 
}tion, Mr. Young pointed out, as 
|}many as fifty nations may be in 
| touch by radio with the ceremonies 
The broadcasts from the Fair be- 
igin at 11:05 A. M. and are to con- 
tinue until 12 P. M. or later. From 
2to 3 P. M., when President Roose- 
velt, Governor Lehman, Mayor La 
Guardia, Grover Whalen and others 
speak, interspersed with music by 
United States and English service 
bands and soloists, the broadcasters 
in New York are to include WEAF, 
WOR, WABC, WMCA, WHN 
WOV, WQXR and WHOM, with 
W3SZ and WNYC joining the net- 
work a half-hour later 

WOV and WNYC will broadcast 
from 5 to 5:30 o'clock when Mayor 
La Guardia and others dedicate 
and unveil the four freedoms 
statues

to protect the route President 
Roosevelt and his party will take 
today in passing through the 
Bronx, across the new Whitestone 
Bridge and through Queens on his 
way to the opening of the World's 
Fair. 

The change in the President's 
plans call for his arrival by train in 
the Mott Haven yards of the New 
York Central Railroad at 11:50 
A. M., and from then until he 
leaves the Fair Grounds, about three 
hours later, he will be guarded 
stantly by city policemen 

On his route through the Bronx 
Morris Avenue, 149th Street, Whit 
lock Avenue and Eastern Boulevard 
—twenty - four superior officers, 
fifty-two sergeants and 1,021 foot, 
mounted and motorcycle patrolmen 
will be responsible for his safety 

When the President’s motorcade 
swings across the bridge and into 
Queens, thence by Whitestone Park- 
way and Lawrence Street to the 
Fowler Avenue entrance to the Fair 
Grounds, the job of protecting him 
will be taken over by a detail of 
58 officers and 1,132 men 

The change in the President's 
plans necessitated the assignment 
of 200 more men than if he had 
carried out his original intention 
and motored from Hyde Park. Then 
he would have skirted, on the

150-Year-Old Coach Will 
Go to the Fair 


Special to Tae New Yorx Times 
ROSLYN, L. 1., April 29.—Thou- 
persons lined the high- 
County vil- 


sands of 


ways of seven Nassau 


lages today to see a 150-year-old 


coach drawn by four horses bearing 
Washington, im- 


General George 


personated by Denys Wortman, and 


his bodyguard and aides arrive 


Because of the traffic jams along 
almost 
Ros 


mill 


the way, the general was 


two hours late in arriving at 


lyn, the site of the first paper 


and the spot where 


in America 
Washington, on his 


Island in 


Inau- 
1789, 
had 


George 
gural tour of Long 


made a sheet of and

with the Henry Onde 
owners of the mill 

The Washington entourage fol 
lowed a Stewart 
Manor through Garden City, Mine- 


ola, Hempstead, the Willistons, into 


route today from 


this village of nine lakes where de- 
scendants of the Onderdonck and 
pioneer families relate inti- 
mate the first 
General Washington 

The party visited the 
Washington after 
Michael J. Hasset had 
them in the historic mill, 
American Legion dugout 
ern, built 186 years ago, was the 
Onderdonck homestead, and the 
story is told that on the morning of 
April 19, 1789, the family was hav- 
ing a breakfast of clams dug from 
Hempstead Bay, near by, when 
word was received that President 
Washington was arriving 

Without finishing the meal, the 
story goes, the clams, plates and 
cups were swept into the tablecloth 
and removed and a repast fit for 
the first President of the United 
States laid before his arrival 

An excerpt from Washington's 
diary was read to those who asked 
why the President chose to come to 
Roslyn. The notation explained that 
Washington wanted to see the mill 
in which the money and bank notes 
were made and learn how the red 
silk threads, an invention 
have Henry Onderdonck’'s 
were run through the paper Rags 
from neighbors all along the North 
Shore, it was explained, were col 
lected to make the first paper notes 

On the coach with the General to- 
day were Colonel David Humphreys, 
impersonated by Laurens M. Ham 
ilton, a lineal descendant of Alex 
ander Hamilton, first Secretary of 
the Treasury; secretary of the First 
Continental Congress Charles 
Thompson (Dr. William 8S. Horton 
of Lynbrook) and Tom, his body- 
guard (Marshall Thomas, a New 
York Negro) 

The Nassau County Historical So- 
ciety sponsored the tour today and 
members of the organization met 
the visitors at their stopping places 

Plans for the county reception 
were made by Dr. Courtney R. Hall 
of Adelphi College, where one stop 
was made and a program of wel- 
come offered on the campus. Mayor 
John P. Hubbell of Garden City 
presided and a dance in costumes 
of Washington's time was included 
in the program 

Among the citizens assisting Dr 
Hall were Meade C. Dobson of the 
Long Island Association, Harry L 
Hedger of Glen Cove, treasurer of 
Nassau County; Miss Jacqueline 
Overton of Westbury, historian and 
librarian; Jesse Merritt, county his 
torian Miss Helga ©. Waline of

on May 8. 

In other years, society, devoted 
as it is to the sport of horse racing, 
waited for the Turf and Field Club 
o-ening to crowd the track, but as 
early as the opening day of the 
present season at Jamaica promi- 
nent men and women and many of 
the junior devotees of racing have 
motored to the old course and gath- 
ered in the ancient brown frame 
clubhouse or strolled in the pad- 
docks, arriving frequently in time 
for an informal luncheon before 
taking their seats 

Next week many of the box-hold 
ers will leave for Lexington to see 
the classic race in which Johns 
town, the William Woodward entry 
which has attracted so much atten- 
tion in the present meeting, will 
run Mrs Woodward and her 
daughters, Mrs. Thomas M. Ban- 
croft, Mrs. John T. Pratt Jr., Mrs. 
Charles A. Moore 3d and Miss Ethel 
Woodward, have been among the 
regular attendants at the track. 


Family Groups Attend 


Family groups have been out 
standing at Jamaica this season as 
they were at Hialeah Park in 
Miami and the Woodwards, who 
have their homes on the North 
Shore and triumphed in the Ken- 
tucky Derby with their famous 
horse, Omaha, are not the only two- 
generation clan that finds the track 
interesting 

Mr. and Mrs. Henry Carnegie 
Phipps, whose estate at Old West- 
bury has extensive stables and polo 
fields, have been attending the 
races with their son and daughter- 
in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Ogden Phipps. 
The junior Mrs. Phipps is the for- 
mer Miss Lillian Bostwick, sister 
of George H. Bostwick, ranking 
polo player. 

Herbert Bayard Swope of Kee- 
waydin in the Sands Point colony 
of Port Washington, has been a 
regular attendant with his daugh- 
ter, Mrs. Robert Lee Brandt, and 
Mr. Brandt. 

Mr. and Mrs. Rufus C. Finch of

College is on display in the Hall of 
Patriots of the main building, 139th 
Street and Convent Avenue The 
exhibition, entirely developed by 
tudents, will be open until May 3 
as “a comprehensive 
exhibition attempts to 
the complete construc- 
filming Wuthering 
Heights currently on Broadway; 
to trace the development of docu- 
mentary, Western and serial stories, 
amd the development of Mack Sen 
nett and Charlies Chaplin comedies 
Through pictures which were bor- 
rowed from the collection of the 
New York Public Library, scenes 
from ‘‘The Great Train Robbery,”’ 
New York Hat,’’ with Mary Pick- 
ford Birth of a Nation’ and 
Sarah Bernhardt’s ‘‘Queen Eliza- 
beth’”’ are shown 

According to Meyer Goldberg, 
president of the society, the group 
is furnishing, outside of the curri- 
culum, a serious approach to mo- 
tion-picture technique and criticism 
in an effort to enable students to 
distinguish good pictures from 
bad 

The exhibition also includes a dis- 
play on the methods and techniques 
of foreign and native directors. 
Represented are Sergei Eisenstein, 
V. I. Pudovkin, René Clair, G. W 
Pabst, Ernst Lubitsch, Cecil B. De 
Mille, King Vidor and Herbert 
Brennon. During the semester the 
society brought the students 
‘Ten Days That Shook the World,”’ 
Mother’’ and the first travelogue, 
cartoon, Chaplin comedy and nar- 
rative film 

Plans for the remainder of 
current semester include the 
entation of two more Chaplin com 
edies, a program the abstract 
film and lectures by Rutherford 
3oyd, exponent of that type of 
film, and Ivens, producer of 
‘Rain” and ‘‘The Spanish Earth.”’ 
On May 13 the society will present 
a movie revival of noted silent films 
and Harold Lloyd comedies

argument is an old one 
Kdgar Chamberlin, who 
was a first-rate journalist, thought 
that he had well employed in the 
pursuit of the education that his 
work afforded the time that he 
might have spent in more formal 
schooling. He was still learning lan 
guages in his sixties and had been 
busy traveling all his life that 
it was not until then that he had 
his first leisure to make a trip to 
Europe. What he wrote from there 
was not from an untutored mind 

But the argument of college ver- 
sus non-college education which has 
gone on for so many years, and 
which long ago shifted to the col 
lege side as the number of degree- 
holders became an increasing pro- 
portion of the population, has now 
turned sufficiently in the opposite 
direction to create new controversy. 
Degree requirements for teaching 
have gone up the point where 
they are questioned by critics quali- 
fied by the abundance of their own 
degrees. 


Both Sides Represented 


The controversy is well represent- 
ed on both sides. Among people 
in education one hears, for exam- 
ple, that only the strong, privately 
endowed colleges which attract 
more applicants than they can ad 
mit can hold the view expressed by 
President Dodds The struggling 
colleges, this argument avoid 
the beca they ry 
student they can get for tuition. 

And, it often said, State’ uni 
versity administrators who private- 
ly believe in limitation cannot ex- 
press themselves in public Also, 
general acceptance of the principle 
that some boys and girls are not 
equipped for college work would

goes,

colleges 

Relating this 
Dodds suggested 
high schools are 
ize that they must differentiate 
their treatment those who can 
and cannot profit from college, the 
struggling liberal arts college i 
order to exist, must stop trying 
pattern its course of study 
those the stronger colleges 
must evolve a different type 
course possibly a two-year 
designed to aid what, in 
tion, is called a “terminal train- 
ing’’ for those who go beyond 
high school but are equipped 
to go the whole way

sity of Chicago has edu-

The College of William and Mary 

this week commenced the selection

under a system embracing the 


candidates the class 
new 
essential requirement of graduation 
the half of the class 


accredited 


in upper from 


an secondary school, 


with a selection of those present- 


ing the strongest qualifications in 
scholarship, character, personality, 
performance in extra-curricular ac- 
tivities and breadth of interest In 
the effort to individualize the stu 
dent's program, William and Mary 
five years ago abolished the old 
unit requirement plan and instituted 
the “upper half’’ plan, which has 
shown itself preferable to the rigid 
unit system and is incorporated in 
the new system 
According the « 
mittee on Admissions 
Dean J. Wilfred Lambert, 
selective system had be 
because 1934 the number of 
applicants meeting the require 
iment of graduation inthe upper half 
of the class has become increas 
ingly greater than the number that 
can be accommodated by the dormi- 
tory and teaching facilities The 
selective plan gives first emphasis 
scholastic preparation and sec- 
ondary consideration to such factors

stoves based on this principle 
in Germany, Swe 
Switzerland, but their de- 
sign not fit the needs of Amer- 
ican households. He said their effi- 
ciency of combustion ranged from 
75 to 90 per cent, against 55 per 
cent and much lower in the ordi 
nary stove 

Stoves and furnaces using the 
slow-combustion principle have ar 
other decided advantage. They need 
to be stoked only twice 
daily instead of the feed 
ing common to the type now in use 
Progress made thus far in study of 
the matter indicates that the new 
heating apparatus will be as great 
an improvement over those now in 
common use as the latter were over

BALTIMORE, April 29.—Chemical 


Hpgineering, a new department in 
the School of Engineering of Johns 
Hopkins University, has grown 
from its inception two years ago to 
take a major place in the engineer-

fourth of all engineering students. 
Begun when there was no other 
Chemical Engineering unit in Mary- 
land, the department is filling a 
need in the industrial life of Balti-

Although conforming in most re 
spects to those already established 
in a number of universities, the 
course at Johns Hopkins stresses 
more than the usual research work 
and a broad basis in chemistry 
This follows Hopkins’ traditions of 
emphasis on research besides a 
thorough introductory foundation

| Children and Parents 


— == By CATHERINE MACKENZIE seecm — 


Children of the same age are not all the same size, but this 
would never be guessed from the dimensions used in children’s 
ready made clothes. They go by age. Yet, as every mother knows, 
Sister looks all arms and legs in a dress that would swamp another 
little girl of 8 

Retailers know it too, and are no happier about it than the 
customers, who keep sending the garments back, or protesting 
about alteration charges. The trouble has been that manufacturers 
have had no standards to go 
by. One guess was as good as 
another. The United States Bu- 
reau of Home Economics has 
now completed the first scien- 
tific study of measurements 
for sizing children’s garments 
and patterns, One hundred and 
fifty thousand typical boys and 
girls, 4 to 17 years of age, have 
been measured in fifteen States 
and in the District of Colum- 
bia. A staff of three anthro- 
pometrists directed the scien- a aan an = ae 
tific measuring, which was MSS AES 
done by fifty-nine Specially trained men and women, assisted by 

‘6 WPA and NYA workers. Many State institutions coc perated 
id funds came from the Works Progress Administratior 

Last week a re presentative gathering of makers and distribu- 

ors met in New York under the auspices of the American Stand- 
is Association to hear about the survey. Miss Ruth O’Brien, 
lef of the government's division of textiles and clothing, who 
il, made the bureau's recommendation that “height and 
nference, or height and chest circumference, or height

While the Council debates 
the desirability and the cost of 
the schools, and where the

the progress of nursery school 
children was checked through

compared with all public school 
children. The study, made in 
Winnetka’s schools, is reported 
to the Society for Research in 

d Development by Dorothy 
Van Alstyne and LaBerta A. Hattwick. The net conclusions agree 
with findings of other researches, that “the nursery school makes 
for social adaptability, independence, self-assertiveness, self-reli- 
ance, and interest in environment.” A significant finding is that 
“the nursery school makes for better emotional adjustrnent and

Day Nurseries 
Broaden Scope 


Standards in Child Care Are 
Being Improved Through 
National Association 


By Mrs. ERNEST FREDERICK 
EIDLITZ 
President, National Association of 
Day Nurseries 

Tony is 3 years old; his mother 
must earn her living and his, and 
there is no one to look after Tony 
while she goes to work. There are 
thousands of children like Tony in 
New York City, aged frém 2 to 6 
years They are too young to go 
to school, and unless they can be 
left with a neighbor, they must, in 
many cases, fend for themselves, 
But not in all cases. Privately sup- 
ported day nurseries in Greater 
New York take care of 10,000 of 
these children in the course of a 
year 

Delegates from many parts of the 
country attended the first annual 
meeting of the National Associa 
tion of Day Nurseries in New York 
last week The association, organ 
ized last year, is a consolidation of 
the former Association of Day Nur- 
series of New York City, founded 
in 1894, and of the National Fed- 
eration of Day Nurseries, formed in 
1898. 

The purpose of the National As- 
sociation of Day Nurseries is to 
raise standards of care among the 
600 day nurseries throughout the 
country. It sets a high standard 
for its own membership which in 
cludes 110 = nurseries—thirty of 
which are in New York. It serves 
as a coordinating body and pro- 
vides a clearing house for informa- 
tion on practices and policies 
Through research, publications and 
field visits, it assists communities 
and groups to establish and main 
tain day nurseries equipped to meet 
present-day needs with programs 
based on the wealth of knowledge 
now available about the needs of 
the pre-school child 


All-Day Care Given 


The day nursery as a social agen 


|cy differs from educational institu 


tions like the nursery school and 
kindergartens. It sees the child { 
relation to its family and offers all 
day care where needed. Its doors 
are open from 7:30 A. M., when 
parents are hurrying to their j 
until the end of the working day

and exercise out-of-doors, and the

familiar routine of midmorning 


orange juice, a nourishing lunch 
and a nap. Some of the nurseries 
have recreation directors; some 
have complete nursery school and 
kindergarten programs. The activi- 
ties vary according to community

horns, harps and grand pianos are 
used for boutonniéres, buttons and 
clips. Music-box handbags tinkle

The ‘‘new woman" as she emerges

neck to knee. Her skirt is flared 
by cleverly placed folds, fan-seams 
xr ruffled sections Among the 
striking innovations launched by 
this designer are short flared day

are slightly reminiscent of the cy

Glamorous dance frocks are of 
starched mousseline, tulle or yards 
of filmy chiffon. The sheer fabrics 
are embroidered in gigantic musical 
notes worked in gold, silver or col

Schiaparelli shows saucy hats

The large brims of forward-tilted

One of the nicest manifestations of the Victorian revival is 
the new golden age of the bicycle. It isn’t necessary for trans- 
portation any more, but more people are bicycling now than at any 
time since the Nineties. They have good and sufficient reasons. 
Bicycling isn’t nearly as much trouble as walking, but it manages 
to give people the smug feeling that they are getting lots of 
healthy exercise and are reducing their waistlines by the minute. 

There are plenty of places for bicycling around the city. The 
handiest one is Central Park, which has about a third of a mile 
roped off exclusively for cyclists. This is particularly valuable for 
people who are just learning. They can feel that even if they do

The traffic goes only one way. 
There are other places around the city, Brooklyn 
and the Bronx both have several areas roped off, for the 
next three weeks the Boardwalk at Coney Island will be available 
every morning. The best place of all, though, is in Queens, where 
ten miles of the old Vanderbilt Speedway (which is now entirely 


unsuitable for speeding) has been given over to the bicyclists.

American history” and “personalities of current history.” 

The panorama includes most of the more highly publicized

financing his trip, for instance, and Pocahontas saving Captain 
John Smith. This one, incidentally, is all wrong. It shows the

Even a panorama ought to be able to catch a detail 
like that. “The Signing of the Mayflower Compact” shows a nice 
assortment of wild-eyed Pil-

One of the pleasanter and less exhausting sight-seeing expedi- 
tions is a trip to Staten Island. It should be a matter of civic 
pride to see that our World’s Fair visitors take advantage of the 
World’s Longest Boat Ride for a Nickel. 

The water in the ferry slip is oily and grubby, but in the bay 
it is blue and authentically mid-Atlantic, and the wind smells salty. 
And, of course, there is much more scenery than in the Atlantic 
Ocean. There are mosquito swarms of tiny tug boats, black, bat- 
tered-looking freighters, and ocean liners of clean, powerful grace

Even people whose ornithological experience has been con- 
fined to canary-keeping shouldn't be surprised to learn that Central 
Park is an excellent place to observe the migratory birds. A tired 
bird passing this way can’t be expected to come to rest in West 
Forty-second Street. He and 
his friends concentrate in the 
which mates them very 
easy to locate. So for the next 
two months the Natural His- 
tory Museum is conducting 
bird walks every Tuesday and 
Friday. They are surprisingly 
interesting. 

The walk begins at 6:30 
A. M., which, on a Spring 
morning, isn’t really a grue- 
some hour. The park is shrill with bird songs: the bird stalkers 
are as excited as if they were looking for pearls on a beach. 

“Could that be a myrtle warbler?” one of them says breath- 
lessly, and all train their field glasses on the bird in question. 
If he turns out to be an English sparrow, 
badly. The lady from the museum, of 
fallible and is never fooled by sparrows. 

“There's a grackle under that bench,” “What's he 
looking for?’’ And the people who have been out a few times are 
able to reply proudly: “Ants.’ 

People who have always looked on birds as anonymous grayish 
creatures will be astonished at the 
the park right now. There are 
winged blackbirds, kinglets (enchanting little birds which look like 
something in “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”), starlings 
grackies and any number of others that non-bird-walkers wouldn't 
expect to see. It is rather a relief to find the familiar fat pigeons 
hanging around the park entrance, cadging peanuts, as usual.

Treatment With Chemical Gas 


Also Greatly Increases 
Bulblet Germination 


To induce gladiolus ‘‘bulhs’’ 
corms to germinate at a time of 
the year when they ordinarily re- 
fuse to do so and to prevent them 
from germinating when it is their 
| custom are two problems in 
| gladiolus culture which have been 
|successfully solved at the Boyce 
Thompson Institute for Plant Re- 
| search. No elaborate procedure or 
|}expensive equipment is necessary. 
|In fact at least four dozen corms 
may be treated for a penny. The 
results of these researches are pub- 


lished in papers issued by the insti- 


tute to which reference should be 
made if one desires to follow the 
process step by step. 

Ordinarily, the gladiolus bulb is 
jin a dormant stage when it is har- 
| vested in the Fall and no attempt 
| is usually made to replant until the 
| following January, as, under nor- 
|mal conditions, it requires a rest 
| period of several weeks. This has, 
of course, rendered impossible the

Winter months. By exposing the 


Fall-harvested corms 
amount of ethylene chlorhydrin 
vapors for four days they are in- 
duced to sprout and germinate so 
that a bloom can be produced by 


January and February. Some va- 
rieties, notably Souvenir and Alice 


Tiplady, were found to be more re- 
sponsive to the treatment than, for 


instance, Minuet and Mrs. F. C. 
Peters.

varieties,

or cormels of many 
unless treated, fail to 
germinate satisfactorily even in the 


Spring of year following har- 
vesting, and often are held in cold 
storage for a second year. It has 
been found that cormels treated 
with ethylene hydrochlorin, can be 
induced to germinate, with a con- 
sequent increase in yield. The yield 
of the treated cormels is, in some 
instances, many times the yield of 
untreated. 

Actual exposure to the gas vapors 
is very simple and, as has been 
mentioned, extremely inexpensive: 
it costs but a cent for three or four 
quarts of cormels. Those to be 
treated are placed in Mason jars 
and a piece of cloth with a small 
amount of ethylene chlorhydrin is 
placed above them. The jar is then 
closed and exposure to the vapors 
is given them for four days. At the 
expiration of that period they are 
planted in the usual manner. 


Prolonging Dormancy 

It has been found possible to pro- 
long the dormancy period of 
gladiolus corms and to break it 
| whenever desired. The procedure, 
jin such cases, is simplicity itself.

Protecting the Garden 


By DR. CYNTHIA WESTCOTT 


Rose growers, having learned 
their lessons from long experience, 
are quite agreed that there is no 


royal road to success in the culture 
of the queen of flowers. But much 


|} of the fog of dissension which form 
erly existed concerning the best 
methods of controlling rose diseases 


has been dissipated. Recent experi- 

ments by experts in a number of 

the leading State agricultural col- 
leges have in marked 
unanimity concerning the necessity 
of controlling rose pests, and the 
best methods of attaining this end. 

The first point of agreement 
reached is that the work of control 
must start with the unfolding of the | 
new leaves, usually from mid-April | 
to the first of May in the vicinity 
of New York City. Then—if the} 
rose lover wishes to make sure of 

a maximum of good rose blooms 
throughout Summer and Fall— 
treatments are continued weekly or 
| biweekly until the close of the sea- 
son. The rose experts point out 
that this is not nearly so much of 
a chore as at first glance it may 
|appear to be, for with adequate 

(and not expensive) equipment, 
|each spraying or dusting in the 
small home garden requires but 15 
| minutes or so. 

Another factor in successful con- 
trol of both insects and diseases 
upon which there seems to be com- 
| plete agreement is that the choice 
| of spray or dust material is less im- 
portant than the ‘‘timing”’ of ite ap- 
plication. 


First Insect to Appear 

The first chewing insect to appear 
is usually the so-called rose slug, a 
| soft-bodied, tadpole-like, velvety 
| Sreen pest that invariably shows up 
}in early May. Later on the slug 
|turns into a small sawfly which re- 
sembles a housefly except for its 
four wings. 

The three common forms of rose 
slug—the European, Coiled, and 
Bristly—are all readily controlled by 
any spray or dust containing lead 
arsenate or rotenone. Young foli- 
oo is examined for the pest, which 
|easily escapes notice until it eats 
away most of the solid green of the 

|leaf, leaving translucent windows 
|}of cuticle stretched between the 
veins. 

Rose chafers (incorrectly called 
rose bugs) appearing toward the 
end of May, present more difficul- 
ties. The ancient method of hand- 


resulted 





| It's strange that so many garden 
enthusiasts will order fertilizer for 
the lawn and for the flower beds 
and yet neglect the trees altogeth- 
er. They need nourishment even 
more than the lawn and flowers in 
most instances. Undernourished 
trees may have a sparse crown of 
sickly, yellowish looking leaves or 
they may get along, year after year, 
with indifferent looking foliage, in 
rich growth.

Certainly trees are more

THE NEW YORK TIMES, _ SUNDAY, APRIL _ 30, 


y Flower Boxes Dress Up | 


City and Country. Windows 


| Annuals and Other Plants and Vines Are Chosen to 
Fit Both the Personality of the House and 


Exposure to Sun or Shade 


By MARIAN 


The material for the city window 
differs in many 
ways from that used either in the 
country or at the seashore. For 
the city, formal or more expensive 
planting, with a definite color 
scheme, is usually planned. How- 
ever, if there is only a smal] corner 
of earth in the city backyard, this 
more costly supply of potted plants 
or flowering bulbs from the florist, 
with care and soil enrichment, can 
be made to establish itself there 
for a garden effect the next year. 
On the other hand, the country 
window or porch boxes for Sum- 
mer are merely an excuse for gaye- 
ty in the midst of plenty. They can 
be used also to accentuate the per- 
sonality of the house. Generally 
the flowering material is of no per- 
manent value. 

But, no matter where flower boxes 
are used, the color of the house it- 
self will determine not only some 
harmonious tone for them but the 
colors of the flowers used in them. 
Against a dull house background, 
for instance, clear, bright flower- 
ing varieties are used, while against 
a brick house, flowers of red, red- 
pink or magenta tones are avoided 
Then, too, plants are also selected 
very carefully as to their suitability 
for either a shady or a sunny ex-

THese potted seedlings are

to brighten dull unsuccessful

sandra are fine for ‘‘staggering"’ in 
between the flowering plants, with 
Vinca minor, or the small-leaved or 
self-branching ivies as_ trailers. 
Potted flowering material from the 
florist which can be shifted along 
are the Spring bulbs, like tulips, 
hyacinths and daffodils, pansies 
English Daisies. When the 
pansies have spent themselves then 
geraniums or long-season bloomers 
like petunias can be substituted.

Then, for the city window box, 
because of adverse growing condi- 
tions, it is generally necessary to 
replenish some ot the material be- 
fore the season is over 3ecause of 
this, it is wiser to avoid a striking 
color scheme or unusual varieties 
which cannot readily be ‘‘matched” 
with new material. Even in a city 
office a simple window box, placed 
on the outside ledge, is practical if | 
selection is made from flowering | 
plants which are easily replaced 
For such a window, a few gerani- 
ums, petunias and dwarf blue lo- 
belia are suitable if the exposure is 
sunny; while begonias, fuchsias and 
some of the sturdy small ferns are 
attractive and practical for the 
shady window 

In a general way, the arrange 
ment in a flower box resembles that 
in a bouquet. Confusion of color 
is avoided; the number of the kinds 
of plant is limited to four or five; 
tall material is placed at the back; 
some contrast in foliage is sought 
and the edge of the box is softened 
by low growing or trailing plants.

Small Fruits for Small Plots 


It is one of the writer’s deepest 
horticultural regrets that the home 
vegetable garden has in so many 
instances disappeared 
suburban small place. Lack of space 
and lack of time (due, apparently, 
to the great number of tinie-saving 
devices we now have at our com- 
mand!) are undoubtedly two of the 


reasons why this change has come 
about.

But even these reasons—for what- 
ever they may actually be worth— 
do not apply to small! fruits, such 
as raspberries, blackberries and 
of these, in

family, need occupy much ground

a pint or more per plant Yields 
of a quart, in good soil and with

Hoboken Tomorrow 


the Hudson 
| Trust Company of Union City, N. J. 


Effective tomorrow, 


the Columbia Trtst 
Company of Hoboken. Shareholders 
of both banks met yesterday and 
voted to merge. 

J. H. P. Reilly, president of Hud- 
son Trust, said shareholders in that 
bank would receive two $6-par-value 
each of the 
40,000 shares of $25-par-value they 
now hold. Holders of the 2,500 $20 
par-value Columbia Trust shares 
will receive shares in Hudson Trust 
on a share-for-share basis. There 
will thus be 82,500 $6-par-value com- 


will absorb 


common shares for 


mon shares of the new bank. 

The Reconstruction Finance Cor- 
poration has agreed to buy for $16 a 
share 187,500 shares of $8-par-value 
preferred stock, redeemable at $16. 
It thus is supplying $3,000,000. 

Mr. Reilly and other officers of 
Hudson Trust will remain. That 
institution has two branches in Ho- 
boken. The one across the street 
from the head office of Columbia 
Trust will take over its accounts at 
the opening of business tomorrow. 

In addition to its common stock, 
Columbia Trust had 2,500 shares of 
3% per cent preferred, $20 par 
value. Anthony J. Volk, president 
of Columbia Trust, said last night 
that it had been paid off. Asked 
if par and accrued dividends had 
been paid, he said he did not know 
and referred the inquiry to Adolph 
Rado, executive vice president. Mr. 
Rado referred the question to a

WALL ST, OPPOSED

State Revenues Viewed as 
Menace to Business 


By HOWARD W. CALKINS

designed by certain legis- 


lative groups in Albany as an al-| were not delivered 


ternative to the proposed State 
sales tax, has met strong opposi- 
j}tion in financial circles. Several 
Wall Street groups have voiced ob- 
jections to the plan on the grounds 
that such an impost likely would 
result in the State eventually losing 
more revenue than it would gain, 
that it would add to the burdens of 
an already harassed industry, and 
that it would, in effect, place an- 
other deterrent in the path of a re- 
opening of the capital market 
Much of the bond business and 
bond underwriting now done here 
would be driven to other States by 
such a transfer tax, it is contended.

the new business placed, with the 
that the outstanding pape 
reduced approximately 50 per

Mr. Dietz pointed out This 
reduction brought down the

total national income, even though 
the latter was also cut, and

One of the factors 
in outstanding paper is the idy 
rise in both wholesale and retail 
automobife sales since the start of 
the year, Mr. Dietz continued. The 
latest available figures covering the 
I of Commercial 
Investment Trust, Inc., chief oper 
ating subsidiary of Commercial In 
vestment Trust Corporation, showed 
that for the first twenty days 
of April retail sales of cars financed 
by the company rose 33 per cent 
over the like period of 1938, as 
against an approximate 25 per cent 
rise in March

Mr. Dietz expressed confi

the business structure. There is no 
inclination on the part of the man-

normal attitude toward the exten- 
sion of credit, he added In this 
connection he said that terms have 
become slightly more relaxed in re- 
cent months, as dealers drive for 
business, but that this tendency has 
been restricted. 

Mr. Dietz concluded with the 
statement that collections were now 
on a highly satisfactory basis, with 
repossessions and credit losses sub- 
stantially below last year In the 
tactoring end of the business, deal 
ing chiefly in textile accounts, on 
a volume of $75,000,000 in the first 
quarter, credit losses showed a big 
improvement over the like period of 
1938, he said

Only Unauthorized Versions 


Barred to Catholics 


To THe Epiror or THe New YorK Times: 
In a issue of Tue New Yor«K 
Times Magazine there appeared under 
the name of L. H. Robbins an interest- 
ing article on the Bible how 
ever, contained a statement involving 
an error historical in saying

The time-worn 
olic Church withholds or 
the Bible from the 
stated in that way, 
The truth is that 

1, The church does and never 
did, forbid the reading of authentic 
copies of the Bible produced with com- 
petent ecclesiastical authorization and 
protected by proper safeguards to pre- 
vent erroneous interpretation. 

2, The church does, and always did, 
forbid the reading of erroneous and 
heretical versions of the Bible and of 
any unauthorized unprotected 
by proper erroneous 
interpretations 

Sir Thomas More, who was Chancellor 
of England under Henry VIII and one 
of the most brilliant men England has 
ever produced, defends this as a reason- 
able course of action; but, reasonable 
or unreasonable, the prohibition against 
what the church considers erroneous 
versions is quite different from a pro- 
hibition of the Bible. 


Tyndale Called Faulty 


It is not unlikely that Tyndale’s trans- 
lation was deemed ‘‘pernicious mer- 
chandise’’ by ecclesiastical authorities. 
According to the Rev. Bertrand L. Con- 
way, C. S. P., in ‘‘The Question Box’”’ 
(The Paulist New York), Tyn- 
dale’s translation of the New Testament 
was a translation containing 
some mistakes and purposely

Jr., the Lions’ stroke, caught a crab 
when three-quarters of the race had 
been rowed. This did not affect the 
result, but did add some distance to 
Navy’s eventual margin of two and 


one-half lengths. 

The veteran Julian Curtiss had the 
varsities away almost on time in the 
fast water and Columbia beat Navy 
to the water at the start The New 
Yorkers jumped about a deck length 
and, holding their racing start 
longer, stayed out a while. Rowing 
at 35, with Navy a couple of strokes 
lower, Columbia stayed in the lead 
almost. to the seawall, but Navy 
caught the Lions there and went to 
a lead which it never relinquished. 

Navy was rowing 33 here and 
Tom Walker was feeding it back 
long and with plenty of rhythm 
The men behind, with their slow 
hands and easy recovery, were 
gradually getting the feel of the 
race, and those on the Speedway in 
the following buses which formed 
an observation train could hear the 


calm voice of Coxswain Virgil Han- 
cock through his megaphone. Navy 
was rowing a calm and collected 
race and had not been unsettled at 
all by the start

Columbia, under the strain of prov- 
ing its promise, and upset by the 
way Navy had come back, began to 
scramble a bit, rush its slides and 
shorten The Lions never settled 
down to row as well as this crew 
s able to do it and will do before 
the season closes. But even at their 
best, they could have caught 
Navy yesterday 

Hank Wheeler kept the beat at 35 

to Navy's 33, and still the midship- 
men gained. At the half mile mark 
they had the better part of a half 
length As Washington Bridge 
loomed Navy had stretched this 
| lead to about three-quarters, Walk- 
er still rowing 33 or 32 and the crew 
spacing six feet. Columbia had gone 
to 36, but was not spacing too w ell 
}nor holding its own 

In between the bridges, Walker 
dropped close to 30 strokes a min- 
ute and the shell really began to 
space. It moved as light as a feath- 
er and was still under headway 
when the men caught the water 
again. The spacing began stretch- 

ling to eight and nine feet and they 

held most of that when they came 
under Highbridge and went to 32 
again 

Wheeler and his mates had gone 
to the high 30’s to try to bring back 
this ghost, but weren't doing it too 
well, and open water appeared. As 
they came under Highbridge, Navy

Right-Hander Settles Down 


After Shakey Start to 
Surprise Blackbirds 


By JOSEPH C, NICHOLS 
Taking kindly to the left-handed 


slants of Phil Caruso, the Manhat- 
{tan College baseball team registered 
| its first starts this 
| season by blanking the Long Island 
| University nine on Manhattan Field 


yesterday, 8 to 0. In scoring their 


| 


victory in five 


less unexpected triumph 
over the Blackbirds, the Manhattan 
athletes poled four home runs over 
the short left-field barrier 

Tom Coughlin, lanky right-hand- 
er, went the route for the Jaspers 
and, after a shaky start which saw 
the visitors get two hits in the 
|first inning, and fill the bases in 
ithe second, settled down to turn in 
a creditable performance, indeed 
In all, the Manhattan hurler yield 
ed only five hits and issued five 
bases on balls. 

Caruso, for the first three innings, 
let the Jaspers down without a hit 
and he had them two down in the 
fourth when the crash came.

his southpaw tosses for a home ru! 
and Harold Connors followed with 
a double. The latter came 
when Frank Rom singled 
Romano himself scored 
a © catcher threw far 
second base to prevent a steal 

These three fired the Man 
hattan forces with confidence, and 
they lost little time after 
Caruso in the fifth. Bill Schwitter 
first up, lashed out a homer and 
Coughlin, following him, drove out 
another four-bagger 

Ted Mazur temporarily interrupted 
the Jasper bombardment by stri 
ing out and Bill Little 
|lowed him, could do no more than 
beat out a single. But Frar Jost 
captain of the home forces, poked 
| the ball over the fence in his 
at the plate to drive Caruso to the 
showers 

Ken Ehlers assumed lief 
role the Blackbirds a] 
ithough he was in difficulties once 
or twice, yielded run, a 
tally which was scored on an out 
field error

WHAT WE, THE PEOPLE, THINK ABOUT EUROPE 


A Cross-Section of Opinion on Our World Role 


By GEORGE GALLUP 
Director American Institute of Public Opinion 
NCE more, as in late July, 1914, the 
American people are looking across 
the Atlantic at a continent that is 
darkened by the possibility of war. 
What are the American people thinking ? 
Most important of all, what do they want 
the United States to do in case war does 
come to Europe? 

Over the past four years the nation-wide 
surveys of the American Institute of Public 
Opinion show a drift and change in Ameri- 
can sentiment.siow at first but 
as a result of the

have reached selected cross-sections of the

and dock-workers, teachers and

can people 
next moves in Europe. And they show 
that nearly all American 


up to two great purposes: 


thinking sums 


The American people want to stay out 
of war 


They want to give all possible assistance 
to the British and French, short of going 
to war, in the event that war does come 

Ever since the armistice the American 
people have been guided by this first prin- 


that the United States should not 
take part again in a European war. The 
strength of the very great. 
And the people think that they should have 
the right, in a national vote, to say whether 
United States troops should ever be con- 


scripted for fighting abroad 


ciple 


idea is still 


Bor together with this belief is a grow 
ing tendency to identify our own 


safety 
and interests with those of Great Britain 
and France. The feeling is increasing in 
the United States today that we must be 
ready to give those nations substantial 
assistance in terms of food supplies and 
war materials 

“Stay out of war.” ‘Help England and 


France.” Anybody who wants to under-

stand the American people today must 


take those two desires into full account. 
fut there are one or two other details 
that stand out sharply in the general pic- 
ture. The first is the widespread American 
expectation that a new European war is

“New York leads the parade of 
cities,’ says Mayor La Guardia. 


By FIORELLO H. LA GUARDIA, 
Mayor of New York 

ANY of the visitors who come to 

the World’s Fair this year will 

be seeing New York City for the 

first time, and their joy at visit- 
ing the greatest metropolis in the country 
may be dimmed somewhat by certain mis 
conceptions about the city which have 
grown into popular belief in some sections 
of the country 

There are ten principal misconceptions 
held, for one reason or another, by people 
living outside New York Perhaps the 
one most widely held is the notion that 
the city is a cold, hard place in which to 
‘ive. As New Yorkers travel, they hear 
their community condemned with the 
phrase, ‘Nice for a visit, but you couldn't 
pay me to live there.” 

Far from being cold, New York is 4a 
warm-hearted and generous community 
Let a great catastrophe happen, and the 
New Yorker is the first person to grieve 
about it and offer what help he can. 

I wish some of the critics could peep 
inside our great city hospitals, where the 
sick and the aged get the finest food and 
the best care we can give them. I wish 
they could see an entire neighborhood 
drop its concerns until our police rescue 
a kitten from a tree. I wish they could 
realize that we spend $10,000,000 a month 
to take care of our unemployed: unfortu- 
nate persons, who, we feel, are without 
work through no fault of their own, The 
city’s share of this great sum is raised 
through relief taxes, which are cheerfully 
paid by those who sympathize with the 
plight of others less fortunate than them- 
selves. This relief undertaking could not 
be maintained a month if the typical New 
Yorker were the cold-hearted person he 
is credited with being In size, our re 
lief load is without parallel anywhere in 


the country 


H AVING spent my early youth in the 
small community of Prescott, Ariz., | am 
able to look at this city through the eyes 
of a Westerner as well as of a person who 
lives here. I know well the open-handed 
friendship of the West, and I also know 
that the people of my city have just as 


much friendship to offer 

People who get to Know each other get 
to like each other. The unfortunate type 
of New Yorker who looks down his nose at 
the stranger merely shows that he has no 
understanding of people in other parts of 
the country. Fortunately, this type is in 
the minority 

No city in the country does more for the 
individual than this great city does. New 
York is the most generous community in 
the country for the simple reason that 
throughout its schools, its hospitals and 
its other public institutions there is less 
inquiry made about the origin of pupils 
and patients than in any other city 

Now take Legend No. 2, which is 


that New York is a city of sweatshops 
That impression is due to the horrible 
working conditions which existed here 
through the Eighteen Eighties. The pio 
neering work in wiping them out was 
Started by Jacob Riis, Samuel Gompers 
Theodore Roosevelt and other outstand 
ing citizens Their work was combined 
with the drive on the slums made by the 
Charity Organization Society and similar 
welfare organizations The first law 
against sweatshops covered bakeries and 
cigar factories. It was enacted to remove 
sweatshop conditions and of course it 
was declared unconstitutional by the 
courts. Later it was modified and became 
effective, 

Today this city is clean of sweatshops 
“Made in New York” is the hallmark of 
superior merchandise, produced under san- 
itary and decent working conditions and 
with decent living wages 


ie there is a mistaken notion that 
this city is strictly a money mart, where 
the first consideration is the making of 
money. Of course New York is the finan 
cial capital of the country, but few realize 
that funds are held in trust here for indus- 
trial enterprises throughout the country 


The person who uses New York as a 
synonym for Wall Street does not realize 
that this city has a soul, and that its resi 
dents are devoted to the best in music and 
art. We have spent more than $225,00v,- 
000 in the last five years on parks and 
playgrounds, primarily for the use of our 
children. We maintain some of the finest 
museums in the world. Any resident or 
visitor to the city can find free concerts 
of really good music without difficulty 
The young artist with ability finds his 
greatest encouragement here, the finest 
opportunities for study, and superior pos- 
sibilities for advancement in his field 

Take the fourth notion that New York 
ers are impolite That's a fallacy also 
because actually they are most consider 
ate. The subway—-where trains running 
one minute apart transport up to 6,000,000 
passengers a day makes for a speed and 
rush which are not necessary in smaller 
communities Analysis of New York's 
rush-hour crowds shows that only a most 
courteous and considerate people could 
live under such conditions. Without good 
humor and without good temper the 
rush-hour crowd would become a disor 
derly mob 

We train almost 20,000 policemen to be 
polite in their dealings with citizens and 
strangers. Every city employe and there 
are more than 155,000 of them is ex 
pected to show kindness and consideration 
in his contacts with the public. I do not 
believe any city should boast because its 
public servants are polite, for courtesy 
should be their habit. I do not expect any 
praise because New York City’s employes 
are considerate. Outside the city service 
the stranger will find cab drivers, waiters 
and almost any one he cornes in contact 
with eager to help him. The average man 
on the street is customarily helpful and 
obliging to those who need his assistance 


Now let us look at the fifth muiscon- 


ception._the idea that the New Yorker 
looks down upon the small-towner. The 
complete answer to that is that the typ- 
ical New Yorker comes from a small town 
himself, or his parents do. There is not 
the slightest trace of any such scorn here 
A young man may come into New York 
off the farm and become a policeman, and 
the policeman born in New York looks 
with longing toward a small-town exist 
ence. That goes up to and includes the 
Mayor. It’s just human nature and we're 
intensely human. Persons are drawn from 
small towns to this city by ambition to 
further their careers. The process in re 
verse sends the city dweller into the coun- 
try Instead of disdaining the small 
country place (Continued on Page 15)

THE "GOOD NEIGHBORS" LOOK AT US 


By T. R. YBARRA 
UR recent $50,000,000 loan to Brazil, 
coupled with the announcement 

that the Export-Import Bank of 

Washington would arrange easier 
terms of payment for Brazilian buyers of 
American products, was promptly hailed 
by believers in our new Good Neighbor 
policy toward Latin America as a step in 
the right direction and as a promise that 
our pleasant relationship with Brazil, ex- 
tending over many years, might now be 
made to embrace the rest of the twenty 
Latin-American republics At the same 
time, the optimism of observers has been 
restrained by the paralle] action of the 
Argentine Republic in cutting down the 
total value of its imports from the United 
States and concluding barter agreements, 
involving millions of dollars, with our to- 
talitarian rivals in South America—Ger- 
many and Italy

culminating incidents in a long record 
of Brazilian-American friendship and Ar- 
gentine-American coolness, serve to call 
attention anew to the whole important 
subject of how Latin-Americans in gen- 
eral feel toward us and how we feel to- 
ward them. This subject took on special 
importance last Winter as a resuit of the 
Pan American Conference at Lima; and 
its importance has now been heightened 
by the renewed onslaughts of totalitarian 
nations, on the European and Asiatic Con- 
tinents, against weaker neighbors, which 
may conceivably lead to similar acts of 
aggression on the American Continents un- 
less we and the Latin-American countries 
make it perfectly clear that such acts 
would be attended with serious conse- 
quences to the aggressors.

tour through a dozen of the Latin-Amer- 
ican republics, which brought the oppor-

proving a strong cement 

Where they have not worked so well is

are special reasons why friendship with

has little or nothing against the average 
American. But with many Chileans

If the government of the moment 1s 
basically Rightist, definitely under the

for generations have dominated Chile, 
then the chances are that the world will 
hear little of “exploitation”’ by American 
or other “‘bloodsucking’”’ foreigners. If, 
on the other hand, Leftist elements are in

vent such ‘‘exploitation’’—-foreshadowed 
by excited talk of measures running all

Just now the Chilean Government,

Leftist; and extremists among his adher-

election speeches of his, have been advo- 
cating moves to curtail the profits of 
American concerns doing business’ in 
Chile. 

Turning back to the Atlantic coast of 
South America, we are confronted by the 
country which, among all the component 
parts of Latin America, is the most pro- 
gressive, the most businesslike, the most 
self-confident, the most aggressive and, 
last but not least, the most anti-American

Where he bade Farewell 
to his of Ficers’ 


IN WASHINGTON'S 
FOOTSTEPS 


By H. |. BROCK 
T was not as a stranger to New York 
that 150 years and one week ago 
George Washington, landing at the 
foot of Wall Street, was welcomed 
with cheers and the thunder of guns to the 
new capital of a new nation. And it was 
not as a newcomer that exactly 150 years 
ago he stood on the balcony of Federal 
Hall.-nearly where his image in bronze 
now stands on the steps of the Subtreas- 
ury Building at Wall and Nassau-—and 
took the oath of office as first President 
of the United States, while a great crowd 
cheered and some wept for joy 
Four times before he had visited the 
city—-still a little city then on the tip of 
Manhattan isiand-—which today has grown 
to be a great metropolis and is celebrat- 
ing his inauguration with the opening of 
its World's Fair 
Washington's first sight of New York 
was in February, 1756. Then he stopped 
over for several ays, « on his way to Bos- 
ton to see the British Commander in Chief, 
General Shirley, He came on horseback 
from Virginia, wearing the blue and 
scarlet coat of a British Colonial officer 
and attended by Captain Mercer, aide-de- 
camp, and two servants in livery New 
York had less than 14,000 inhabitants and 
General Braddock's defeat, in which 


Washington's gallantry had attracted gen- 
eral admiration, had occurred only the 


_year before 


r 
os second visit was im April, 1773, 
after the Stamp Act crisis had passed 
Coming up to enter at Columbia's fore- 
runner, King’s College, his stepson John 
Parke Custis—-who was a bit of a scape 
grace Washington arrived here on the 
27th and attended a farewell dinner to his 
Sraddock, Lieu 


tenant General Thomas Gage, now in turn 


companion-in-arms with 


British Commander-in-Chief, and the same 
who was involved in Boston’s troubles 
New York had then only 20,000 souls and 
the inhabited town began to fade out into 
green country about at City Hall Park 

When Washington went North to take 
command of the Continental Army outside 
of ,Boston in July, 1775, he did not come 
into the city as it was then But he 
stopped at King’s Bridge to put General 
Philip Schuyler in command of the Amer- 
ican forces in New York 

He came next in April, 1776, after he 
had driven the British out of Boston. He 
was busy about Manhattan until late in 


October of that year. That was a little 
while before the capture of Fort Washing- 
ton, on Nov. 16, forced the retirement of 
what was left of his shattered troops 
from the line that he had held across the 
northern part of the island the line of 
which the other strong points were Fort 
Tryon and Fort George 

The American Commander in Chief's 
headquarters, from April 13 until the de 
feat of his army on Long Island, was at 
the Richmond Hill Mansion, in Greenwich 
Village, near the intersection of Varick 
and Charlton Streets the same house 
which had been used by Sir Geoffrey Am 
herst After the British landing at Kips 
Bay, Sept. 15, 1776, Washington trans- 
ferred to the house of Colonel Roger Mor 
ris on the heights at 160th Street (over 
looking the present Polo Grounds), re 
maining there until Oct. 21 This was 
his headquarters during the one success- 
ful engagement that his army fought on 
this island -the Battle of Harlem Heights

STILL OUR NO. | AIRMAN 


By RUSSELL OWEN 
MERICA’S No. 1 airman is back in 
his own country. Recalled to active 
duty in the army recently and put 
to work studying the aviation re- 
search facilities of the United States, 
Charles A. Lindbergh took up a task for 
vhich he is pre-eminently fitted, and one 
vhich probably gives him a good deal of 
pleasure

HERE are probably two reasons why 
Colonel Lindbergh has been asked to un- 
dertake this survey. One is that the Na- 
tional Committee on Aeronautics, which is 
an independent organization set up by 
Congress to study aviation problems, has 
found difficulty in persuading Congress 
that facilities must be expanded if we are 
to remain ahead of European countries, 
particularly Germany. Lindbergh’s name 
will help them 

The second reason is that of all the men 
actively engaged in aviation there is none

On his last visit to this country, for in-

grasped its principles, able to 
give a lucid description of it and answer 
the questions asked of him by men with 
much better technical training 

That he can do this is all the more re- 
markable in that: his own engineering 
training was sketchy. He had some in 
the University of Wisconsin where he en- 
tered the mechanical engineering course, 
but he left in less than two years to enter 
a flying school at Lincoln, Nebraska. He 
also got a little engineering at the army 
training schools in Texas, but it was noth-

for the swift hoofbeat of a pygmy buffalo,

of fat guinea fowls, for hours on end not 
even a breath of wind disturbs the vivid 
pattern of shades and lights that the tire- 
1eSS sun designs on the hard ground 

Every ten or fifteen miles one of the 
oulwarks of vegetation has been labori- 
ously pushed back, stingily to give room 
for a growth of small huts, each a well- 
thatched roof overiapping a windowless 
circle of dried mud, often brightly deco- 
rated with white, red and brown paintings 
Here, too, silence and 
guiet reign all day long 
Only some thin, long- 
legged native chickens 
and half a dozen big- 
bellied, wide-eyed chil- 
dren have remained 
behind to represent the 
population of the vil- 
lage. Every man has 
been away since early 
morning to follow an- 
imal tracks or to find 
g00d ironwood for ar- 
rows and spears; and 
all the women are wan- 
dering through the 
dark tunnels of the jun- 
gie paths in search 
of sweet roots, wild 
bananas, succulent 
white ants heart-

But all this silent world is suddenly viv-

With the Gatti trailer caravan in 
darkest Africa — Above, a holt

Have you thought 
of taking a vacation trip by 
trailer through the Belgian Congo? 
Some day you may. The author of 
this article, a veteran African explor- 
er, is now mapping trailer routes in 
the African jungle, and at the 

tribes and animal life. 


tells of news that never before has been 
heard. It says that great Musungu are 
coming. But not by foot, nor by cars like 
those the other white men use. These are 
coming with their own houses; even inside 
their houses, which contain many magics 
unknown to the jungle’s people. Such as 
strong lights that go and come by them- 
selves and burn without any smoke; and 
little machines that make a strong wind 
that cools off the day’s heat. Such as 
water that now is water and then trans 
parent stone which burns the hands if 


touched, yet can make other waters as 
cold as those of the coolest spring. Such 
as «a rope into which one talks and the 
voice at once pops out at the other end 
far away and a little box from which 


loud songs and great musics come out at 















will; and another big one that takes in 
all songs and musics of a Native and keeps 
them alive inside. 

And these houses, filled with many oth- 
er marvels more than one can understand 
or describe, are not built with many poles 
deeply planted in the ground. They look 
like elephants, but have wheels instead 
of legs, and can run fast on the road or 
go and stay wherever the Musungu want. 
Wah! 


‘Ts purring of a motor finally ap- 
proaches, and suddenly a hush falls on the 
crowd. The Musungu are coming, with 
their magic houses. Shouts of excitement 
invariably announce the appearance of 
our gray and blue station wagon which

vehicle arriving from the opposite direc-

Yachts, our two forty- 
foot trailers, follow and 
fill up the road. Just 
as invariably, however, 
the shouts die into 
a murmur of disillu- 
sionment as soon as it 
is seen that it is noth- 
ing more than another 
car has come. 





Fortunately another, deeper, purring is 
heard. Soon from the bend of the road 
another, bigger radiator slowly appears, 
its chrome moldings brightly reflecting 


every light. Then a blue fender and a 
shining stainless steel wheel, a gray cab, 
a double wheel with another and longer 
blue fender, and the beginning of a round, 
silver roof over a gray wall pierced by 
one window after another. Then again, 
another shining double wheel under 
another biue fender, and finally a rounded 
back, the resplendent bumpers, the striped 
awning protruding over the rear window 


Awe at the sight that no one has ever 
seen before lifts up dozens of hands to 
cover silent mouths—the native’s deepest 
sign of an astonishment that only mur- 
mured “Wah! Wahs!” can underline. 


The marvel approaches, smoothly glides 
before every eye, is already going away. 
Wah! Through the back window of the 
observation car they discover me working 
at my desk, which occupies the entire end 
of the first trailer. The children leap in 
our wake, grown-ups follow, all the vil- 
lage is soon madly running after the trail- 
er, jumping, calling, yelling, as if unable 
to let go that vision of the Musungu busily 
at work in his own house that goes where- 
ever he goes!

the warning that another vehicle is ap- 
proaching; and from my desk I can watch 
the hasty retreat of the crowd toward the 
safety of the ditches, from which point 
everybody fully enjoys the arrival of the 
second trailer. This is always the biggest 
star of our column and the one obtaining 
the greatest success, for the first aston- 
ishment has been appeased and all the 
spectators are now able to take in more 
of the details of our sleeping car, exclaim 
at the delicate colors of its interior, ex- 
plode with delighted surprise at the flash- 
ing glimpses of themselves that they can 
catch through the windows in the big 
wardrobe mirrors that adorn our bed- 
rooms.

labor in Africa and had built piece by 
piece during months of toil in America, 
were making their first run along another 
and broader way, through another and 
quite different jungle, that of Manhattan’s 
skyscrapers 

Reporters of all the New York papers 
were impressed by the elegance of line 
that Count de Sakhnoffsky had given to 
our ultra-streamlined units, but incredu- 
lous that such huge units could ever travel 
over African roads, ford wide tropical 
rivers on precarious pontoons or man- 
age the river barges on which they would 
have to be loaded and unloaded far in the 
interior without the help: of mechanical 
devices. 


g a same skepticism has followed us 
ever since when the trailers were 
landed from an American freighter at Ma- 
tadi, Congo’s only port on the West Coast; 
when they reached by train Leopoldville, 
Congo's capital; and, worse than ever, 
when a powerful crane loaded all our ve- 
hicles on special hundred-ton barges to 
reach, after a fortnight on the Congo 
River, Stanleyville, where our. expedition 
was to begin its work and our Jungle 
Yachts their “navigation” of forest and 
mountain roads.

But one old villager (lower right) had to see before believing. 


Little as the Belgians themselves realize 
it, the road system here is the best in 
Central Africa. Necessarily narrow 
through the almost entirely unexplored 
jungle that: covers two-thirds of Congo’s 
area; wider across the great game plains 
of the Pare National Albert and the im- 
mensely rich copper fields of the Katanga; 
really imposing in breadth throughout the 
elephant country, these highways have 
been designed with rare skill to avoid or 
overcome enormous natural obstacles, and 
are kept constantly in condition by a good 
part of the 12,000,000 dusky native popu- 
lation 


The violence of tropical elements some- 
times makes a bridge momentarily inse- 
cure or a piece of road so muddy and slip- 
pery that it would be dangerous for any 
car to try to drive over it. But Africa 
has its own remedy for every one of its 
own ills. It is only a question of knowing 
when to switch from suddenly helpless 
horsepower; when to make appeal to the 
good-natured ever-ready, willing assist- 
ance of a near-by village whose folk will 
always come out en masse at any hour of 
day or night to find and bring new planks 
to push or lift if necessary and carry a 
car across a bad stretch.

It's a submarine, a surface car, a scenic railway, this subway that speeds underground and ‘‘up in the air,’ bearing 2,279,684 New Yorkers on their daily round.

They will find the underground system 
a 273-mile network linking them and the 
2,279,684 New Yorkers who use it twice 
daily to the farthest reaches of every 
borough but Richmond. If they choose a 
quiet period, say between 11 A. M. and 3 
P. M., they will find each car a moderate- 
ly comfortable vehicle for exploration and 
observation as well as rapid transit, com- 
bining the virtues of surface car, scenic 
railway and submarine. If, misguided or 
defiant, they dare it at rush hour-—8 to 
9 A. M. or 5 to 6 P. M.—they will be 
caught up in a unique phenomenon, a riot- 
ous hurly-burly demonstrating more than 
anything else the incredible compressibil- 

ity of the human body 
But no matter when, there 
reasons for using the subway, whether the 
passenger is from Manhattan, Kan.; Man- 
hattan, Mont., or Manhattan Island. For 
5 cents he can travel 22.65 miles without 
transferring (Van Cortlandt Park to New 
Lots Avenue) or 220.81 miles if he doesn’t 
mind changing and doubling back a bit. 
For a maximum of 30 cents he can com- 
bine different routes into a trip forty-four 
miles longer than from New York to Bos- 
ton. Doing so, he will find himself “up in 
the air’ almost one-third of the time by 
means of that paradox, the elevated divi-

From the windows of the train he may 
see astonishing woodland stretches in the

MAN AND HIS CITIES 


By KARL SCHRIFTGIESSER 


OR millenniums man has built cities—at first 
open cities and green and close to the land, 


but later, as stone was piled on stone, con 


gested, noisy cities. Today the city, made 
by man, is in some respects man’s enemy. Dense, 
crowded, jumbled, in some parts airless and self- 
hidden from the sun, it houses its multitude in many 


ways. Some of these ways are not so pleasant. 


It is a dramatic story—this of The City. Seldom 
has it been told more dramatically than in a four- 
reel film that will be an integral part of the City- 
Planning Exhibit in the Science and Education Audi- 
torium at the World’s Fair. Here the visitor may 
see the drama, both tragic and comic, unfold, in a 


moving document made from life. 


The “stills” on these pages were made by Ralph 
Steiner and Willard Van Dyke in the course of 
filming the moving picture. The captions are quoted 
from the poetic narrative written by Lewis Mum- 
ford to accompany the film. Together they give a 


vivid summary of the production. 


“Tne City,” as the moving picture is called, was 
sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation upon the ad- 
vice of a committee of architects and city planners 
and was produced by a group of artists. Between last

SUN AND 
AIR 





“We worked from sun 
to sun 

Hf you can call just 
work 

A job that mokes us 
feel 

At peace, a-doing it.... 

We planted rows of 
elms 

Along the street: 

We dug the gardens 

Our mothers minded... 

The town was us 

And we were part of 
it” 


“A century or two ago 

We built our church 

And marked the Com- 
mon out. ... 

We know ow rights 
and duties 

In town meeting: 

No harm if we dis- 
agree— 

In all that matters 

We neighbors hold to- 

gether.” 


July and February two camera men recorded patches 
of life, some unpleasant and some delightful, in the 
villages of New England, the industrial areas of the 
Monongahela Valley, the turbulent cities of New 
York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and the model com- 
munities of Greenbelt, Md., and Radburn, N. J. 
They followed the outline of Pare Lorenz, author 
of “The Plow” and “The River.” 


Their thousands of feet of film, for which no- 
body consciously posed, have been worked into a 
dramatic sequence by Henwar Rodakiewicz and 
Oscar Serlin. It starts with the story of the begin- 
ning of the American city, when there was light and 
air and quiet living. Then it crashes into the blight 
of industrialism, the growth of the metropolis, the 
city of today with its great concentration. And al- 
ways against the background of stone and steel, and 
under the smoke and in the midst of its traffic, it 
shows people living out their enforced way of life. 

Then, quietly, it moves into the “Green City,” 
where men and women live in serene comfort and 
children safely play in sun and tree-given shade. As 
background for this contrasting story, this history 
of gregarious America, Aaron Copeland has pro- 
vided an original score that catches the mood of 
both Megalopolis and modern planning.

A GOOD FISH DESERVES A

N a 
anglers are standing happily 
and hopefully in water up to 
their knees. In lakes, rivers, 

a guif and two 


thousand streams trout 


seas commer- 
cial fishermen are working with 
the renewed impetus of the 
season. AS much as the young 
man’s fancy, both pursuits are 
proof patent of Spring. And 
though the tangible results in the 
case of the may be 
more ecstatic words and less ma- 
terial evidence, the 
fisherman's activity accounts for 
the welcome presence in the mar- 
ket of butterfish, smelts, fresh 
salmon, bass, shad and shad roe 
as the gourmet’'s delight, and a 
host of other piscatorial evidences 
of May. For the initiate the 
password may therefore be not a 
lilting rondel of love but some- 
thing like a chanted “Anchovy 
and hollandaise, béchamel and 
béarnaise.” It is the season for 
fish, and fish presuppose sauces.

Sauces in their turn predicate 
an artist’s knowledge of and re- 
spect for white sauce, parent to 
almost all good fish sauces. This 
is the one to which the Italian 
nobleman referred when he ac- 
cused the English of having many 
religions but only one sauce. It is 
what a British gourmet termed 
the “national disaster,” which 
when mixed with alum becomes 
paste for billboards. Yet a care- 
fully prepared white sauce, chefs 
assert, plain or with nothing more 
than two or three tablespoons of 
capers or chopped parsley added, 
can add the seal of the epicure’s 
approval to a fish dinner.

are inexpensive and popular with 
cooks and their subjects. Proper- 
ly boiled in seasoned water, they 
both merit and do justice to a 
fine white sauce. And broiled 
fresh salmon steaks, esteemed by 
the fastidious Spring diner-out, 
win new laurels in the home 
when brought to the table under 
a blanket of white. 

A standard recipe for this im- 
portant master sauce calls for 
three tablespoons each of butter 
and flour, a cup of milk (or white 
fish stock), and salt and white 
pepper to taste. The or 
basic paste, is made by melting 
the fat and adding the flour 
gradually, stirring constantly for 
five minutes. Only then should 
the liquid be added, for that pre- 
liminary cooking, as the French 
well know, insures a sauce that 
will not taste disagreeably of raw

Experts abjure any additional 
sauce when the shad or roe is 


broiled in butter. But when simply

broiled, the accompaniment can 
be drawn butter or maitre d’hdétel 
sauce. The former is made from 
a roux of one-sixth of a cup of 
butter and three tablespoons of 
flour, to which salt, pepper and 
lemon juice are added before a 
pint of boiling water is poured 
into the pan. Another sixth of a 
cup of butter is beaten in gradu- 
ally, while the mixture boils for 
five minutes. 

With the addition of chopped 
parsiey and two egg yolks (good 
cooks need not be reminded that 
no sauce should boil after yolks 
are added), two cups of drawn 
butter metamorphose into maitre 
d’hétel sauce, which is something 
to lift ordinary broiled mackerel 
bluefish or split shad into the 
category of ambrosia. 

Fresh smelts brighten the life 
of the fish appreciator. One au- 
thority suggests using skewers 
to fry each individual’s portion to 
a rich, golden brown and serving 
with lemon drawn butter sauce. 

“Boiled salmon with hollan- 
daise, plain boiled potatoes, cu- 
cumber salad.” Varied perhaps by 
broiling the fresh salmon and 
serving it with béarnaise sauce, 
this should be as popular at home 
as it is in the restaurant of an 
exclusive New York hotel. 


, hollandaise, the Bureau 
of Home Economics reports, must 
consist only of butter, egg yolks, 
lemon juice, 
little boiling water, cooked care- 
fully in the top of a double 
boiler. Substitute tarragon vin- 
egar for the lemon juice or add 
chopped fresh tarragon and par- 
sley, and the result is béarnaise, 
which a famous cookery savant 
recommends with any broiled or 
grilled fish. Add chopped an- 
chovies or some anchovy paste, 
and the result is a sauce that can 
be served separately with any 
fish, particularly broiled or fried 
varieties 

Plain broiled fillet of sole with 
the ever-popular tartar sauce is 
something that will always perk 
up the most jaded appetite. But 
this is Spring, an expert reminds 
us: one must make a little extra 
effori. So why not make the sole 
really trés recherché by serving 
it with a good red or white wine 
sauce, made from a basis of well- 
seasoned fish stock? For that

TEN MISCONCEPTIONS OF NEW YORK 


(Continued from Page 3)

that New Yorkers lack

New York has taken the lead-

standards and high economic 


standards for its workers. That 
leadership gives a direct and tan- 


gible benefit to the men and wo- 


men who work here, and it has 


not yet been paralleled in any 
other part of the country. New 
York has indicated that it will 


not reduce these standards to the 
low base where exploitation of la-

Through the pro-

JUT his work with these com- 
panies, particularly Pan Ameri- 
can, showed that Colonel Lind- 
bergh was developing an acute 
intelligence in his field and a 
distinct ability in both research 
and engineering. He has special- 
ized in problems of fuel consump- 
tion and fuel control, in the 
strengthening and design of fly 
ing boat hulls, in heavy wing 
loading, that is, bringing about 
a heavier load per square foot of 
wing surface; and latterly in 
problems involving personnel and 
flight control 

These are extremely compli- 
cated matters, which can some- 
times be worked out on an en- 
gineer’s slide rule-—which Lind- 
bergh can use, incidentally—-but 
which frequently are only solved 
by trial and error and the applica- 
tion of good horse sense, as well 
as an instinct for the proper an- 
swer Heavy wing loading, in 
which Igor I. Sikorsky was the 
pioneer in this country, has al 
ways interested Lindbergh in- 
tensely, for such wing loading 
means larger commercial loads. 
It involves design and structural 
strength, as well as power and 
fuel consumption problems 
When Colonel Lindbergh made 
his survey flights across the North 
and South Atlantic, about which 
his wife wrote “Listen, the 
Wind,” the accomplishment of 
which the flier was most proud 
was that his plane carried a wing 
loading of about’ thirty-seven 
pounds a square foot. When it is 
realized that the present big 
transports have a load of only 
about twenty pounds and the

present big clippers have a wing 
loading of about thirty-five 
pounds, it can be realized what 
Colonel Lindbergh did and why 
he had such a hard time getting 
off the water in Africa on his 
flight across the South Atlantic 

When he was flying over Maya 
ruins in Yucatan on an archaeo- 
logical survey mission it was 
necessary to carry every bit of 
fuel possible because of the long 
flights over jungles Colonel 
Lindbergh went over every inch 
of the plane, cutting down unnec- 
essary weight He even took 
screws out of the window cas- 
ings and removed the ash trays, 
And then he scared the wits out 
of those flying with him by run 
ning a gas tank absolutely dry 
so that the engines would sputter 
and pop, before he would turn on 
a fresh tank. When the engine 
picked up again he would grin at 
his passengers, one of whom was 


Mrs. Lindbergh 


oh i is one untold tale about 
Lindbergh which shows not only 
the gayety he had in the first 
years after his famous flight, but 
also his unalterable conviction 
that a man can do what he plans 
to do. While he was in Mexico 
City on his first flight there he 
went out with some Mexicans on 
a deer hunt. It was a wild ride 
for Lindbergh was beating deer 
out of the bush with his plane, 
flying low over the tree tops, 
zooming and dropping down again 
in circles to scare the deer into the 
open. It was not exactly safe fly- 
ing, but it was sport 

When there were some deer in 
sight Lindbergh landed in an open 
spot. The hunters with him were 
so jittery from the tree-skimming 
that they couldn't hold their rifles 
steady. Finally, a Mexican army 
officer, a crack shot, lay down on 
the ground to keep his arms 
from shaking and shot a deer 
He looked up at Colonel Lind- 
bergh and said 

“Young man, that was a fine 
shot.” 

“Well, you planned to hit him, 
didn't you?" was Lindbergh's 
reply 

But most of his work during 
this period was serious research 
on plane operation. He threw 
himself heart and soul into doing 
everything he could to build up 
commercial aviation. His entire 
emphasis was on safety and reg- 
ularity of operation. The last 
flight he made for a commercial 
airline was in 1934, and he went 
on the test flights of the S-42 
across the Caribbean 

That was also the first time a 
multiple crew, a crew working 
in shifts and changing their 
tasks, trained in ocean flying, 


OUR NO. 1 
AIRMAN 


was used. Colonel Lindbergh went 
along aS an expert on fuel con 
sumption Since then he has 
done no commercial flying of 
this kind, and has confined him 
self to study on land of the ef 
fects of flight on personnel, the 
training of men for ocean flying 
and the various factors which en 
ter into the efficiency of big fly 
ing boats on trans-oceanic trips 


As a matter of fact, startling 


as it may seem, Colone! Lindbergh 
is no longer qualified to fly one 
of the big clippers across the 
ocean Not that he could not 
soon learn to take it off and land 
it, and operate it in flight, but 
the very qualifications which he 
has helped set up for the flight 
personnel disbar him from being 
one Of them. It has been sug- 
gested that Colonel Lindbergh 
might go as co-pilot on the first 
commercial flight of the Yankee 
Clipper to Europe. He could not 
even act as first officer, or co 
pilot, because the first officer 
must be a graduate engineer, and 
also hold licenses as an airplane 
mechanic and engine mechanic 
Colonel Lindbergh has none of 
these. He could fly, operate the 
radio and navigate, but he doesn't 
fill the bill in other ways 

Now Colonel Lindbergh has 
entered on another phase of his 
career national service. He was 
asked to survey the research fa 
cilities of this country because he 
ras seen as much, if not more 
than, any other American of the 
research work abroad 

There wasn't much for him to 
lo when he went to Europe. He 
did not want to immure himself 
in the pleasant English country 
side, or to live entirely on. his 
lonely island off the coast of 
France. So he hopped around 
Europe. He visited every impor- 
tant aviation center, even Russia, 
and his prestige gave him access 
to research laboratories and man 
ufacturing plants, as well as 
training fields, which was denied 
to most foreigners And he 
sopped up information like a 
sponge. It has been said that he 
was fed fairy tales and believed 
them, but that presupposes a gul- 
libility which would be unusual in 
any airman trained as Colonel 
Lindbergh has been 


| ll the limitations 


both of research and manufactur- 
ing, as well as pilot training, his 
observations enabled him to check 
what he was told. And he defi- 
nitely sought information, because 
he thought in that way he might 
be of some value to his own 
country All his friends who 
have talked with him about his 
investigations abroad agree on 
that point. What he learned he 
transmitted to the Army Ajir 
Corps and to the National Ad- 
visory Committee on Aeronautics 
And there is no doubt that it has 
been of considerable value 

It is with this background of 
what he learned abroad that he 
is doing his present work. There 
have been constant warnings 
from army officers and from ci- 
villian engineers engaged in avia- 
tion research that this country is 
in danger of falling behind Eu- 
ropean countries. They want to 
remedy that condition, and there 
is no name quite so potent as 
that of Lindbergh to focus na- 
tional attention on this condition.

And here in New York, where 


autograph hunting has assumed

the League of New

Very often the well-known

burned to the ground.”

A HE ietter-writing method, 
particularly in New York, has be- 
come passé, though it is used on 
occasion for dealing with highly 


inaccessible persons. Instead of 
writing, the autograph hunters 
make their requests in person, 


thus giving themselves the thrill 
of seeing and sometimes speaking 


to people in the public eye. At

Saturday is perhaps the busiest 


day of the autograph seekers. Be- 


fore embarking on the hunt most 
of them meet informally along 
Forty-third Street between 
Seventh and Eighth Avenues 
about noon. Here along the curb 
they exchange intelligence, in- 
forming one another who of im- 
portance has arrived in town dur-

celebrities staying; where 
they regularly have luncheon and 
dinner, and what shows they have 
bought tickets for. Such infor- 
mation has been culled from the 
hotels, restaurants and theatre

ades ago 


sian: the greatest depar- 
ture has been in the character of 
the manikins who wear the 
clothes. The old time figures, 
reminiscent of the wax works of 
Mme. Tussaud, have gradually 
given way to highly stylized and 
sophisticated “actresses.” Mod- 
eled as carefully as statues de- 
signed for an art show, and cost- 
ing about $150 apiece, these fig- 
ures are designed by an artist 
who specializes in that kind of 
work 

The original clay statue is made 
from model or 
copied from a design. It is then 
cast in plaster and the figure it- 
self is frequently sent to a fac- 
tory, where it produced in 
quantities and various 
stores all over the country. Filex- 
ible models, stuffed and covered 
with a kind of elastic cloth, are 
easy to handle, but those made 
of papier-maché, plaster, or vari-

that they easily

Manikins today may be made 
of any material, but the trend is 
toward figures in a natural pose. 
The woman represented is so- 
phisticated, smart. The hair may 
be made of wool, yarn, silk, metal 
ribbon, wire, in short of almost 
anything, but it is usually expert- 
ly coiffed by an experienced hair- 
dresser. Nails may be manicured 
and tinted with the latest shade 
of red. The whole body is modeled 
so that it is quite unlike the 
stuffed doll with a head, hands 
and arms of china or wax which 
in the old days of more conceal- 
ing garments was considered an 
adequate dummy on which to 
hang the costumes of the period. 


(id... of the most spectacular 


innovations in shop windows has 
been the use of “invisible’’ glass, 
which was introduced in New 
York in 1935 and can now be seen 
in quite a number of shops along 
Fifth and Madison Avenues. It is

When surrealism became the

a window. In it

Is it horse-show week? Then 
a store displays windows with 
the scene laid in Madison Square 
Garden in which great plush 
horses rear and go over the 
jumps and a tallyho takes beau 
tifully clad ladies for a ride. Has 
the Metropolitan revived Char- 
pentier’s “Louise’’? We see a 
scene from the opera with a room 
of the period, a table complete 
with French earthenware, casse- 
clothes hanging on the 
hooks and the outdated footlights 
striking just the appropriate 
note.

roles, 


Are shop windows of the new 
type the most recent manifesta- 
tions of a new art, or are they 
just super-salesmanship? They 
seem to be a logical development 
of industrial design, of modern 
art as applied to everything in 
daily life from a locomotive to a 
simple little ashtray; for when 
a refrigerator, a baby carriage, 
and a child’s toy receive the im- 
print of the newest ideas, it is 
only natural that that great 
show, the shop windows of the 
city, should receive it also. In 
them the theatre and the adver- 
tising man have joined forces 
with the store executives and to 
gether they have worked out a 
combination of theatrical show- 
manship, commercial advertising 
and traditional merchandise tech-

ited time only 

Here is why this new special 20% reduc- 
tion is being offered to youg During the 
winter months, the Arthur Murray instruc- 
tors held dance classes on cruise ships and at 
winter resorts. These classes proved so suc- 
cessful that an additional number of sum- 
mer hotels have already contracted for mem- 


bers of our staff. As a result there will be 


a shortage of teachers at the New York 
Studios during the early summer months-— 
when our low rates are usually in effect. 
Therefore, we offer special low rates NOW. 


The greatest benefit of this new rate pol- 
icy is to you. You get the expert, carefully 


planned Arthur Murray instruction—at an 
important 20% saving. 


Learn to Dance the Waltz, 
Rumbe, Fox Trot or Tango 


Try the “key step” pictured on this page

dancer—to master the smart, new steps. It’s 
tun. And very inexpensive now that rates 
are reduced. There isn’t a dull moment in 
taking these dance lessons—you have a de- 
lighttully good time every second. You learn

America-—with talented instructors,

this special 20% discount is effective for only 
a limited time. As soon as the schedules for 
all instructors are filled, this unusual offer 
will, of course, have to be withdrawn. It is 
suggested, therefore, that you reserve your 
instruction time at your very earliest conve- 
nience. Studios open daily until 10 P. M. 





Many of Carol Andrews’ pupils 
come regularly long after they 
have learned to dance—-for the ex 
ercise—and for the fun of dancing.

SWALD GARRISON VILLARD, for 


many years a militant liberal editor, 


has lived constantly in a world of 


controversy, and it is inevitable 


that anything he writes must be 
highly provocative. Throughout

New York Evening Post and The 
Nation he has battled valiantly for 
causes that have appealed to his 
and his sense of 


humanity jus-

Through these years he 


mak-

history and intimate as-

This intimacy continued through 
the first Administration, but with 


the outbreak of the World War 
he found his enthusiasm slowly 
cooling, until, finally, he was to 


conclude that “it would have been 


better for the country if Champ 


Clark had been nominated” since 
in that event, ‘this ountry 
would never have gone into the

intimate contacts with the White

‘too proud to fight.’ 

In a curious way I had not 
been two days in Washington 
before I supplied the President 
through Tumulty with a phrase 
which brought down him 
a storm of abuse and denuncia- 
tion. The words “too proud to 
fight” were mine. When they 
were denounced as craven and 
‘owardly Tumulty came to me 
in a state of great alarm. I 
explained that when I gave 
him that phrase without the 
slightest idea that it would be 
offered verbatim to the Presi-

the words ‘because there are 
other and better ways of 


settling international disputes

to Emile Bernard. Edited, trans-

Douglas Lord. 32 plates, 135

By EDWARD ALDEN JEWELL 
[KE the previously published 
letters to his brother Theo 

oF and to Anton Ridder van 
Rappard, these (now for 

the time available in Eng- 
lish) written by Vincent van 
Gogh to the French artist Emile 
Bernard are alive, on every page, 
with the ever valiant though tor- 
mented spirit of a man who could 


first 


hauntingly and always most hu- 
manly reveal himself in words. 
Much has written about 
Vincent van Gogh; much that is 
illuminating and perceptive and 
deeply sympathetic; much also, 
as Douglas Lord reminds us, that 
is “both inaccurate and ficti- 
tious.” The in which he 
unpacked his heart and released 
the often and searching 
thoughts of his mind, remain, in 
most poignant 
and direct source knowledge. 
On that their importance 
could hardly be exaggerated. It 
is, therefore, with a quickening 
sense anticipation that one 
turns to the present sheaf of cor- 
respondence, just as it is with re-

AMERICA’S SILVER AGE. The

By HENRY STEELE COMMAGER 

HE statecraft of the Sil- 
66 ver Age,’ Mr. Johnson 
asserts, “was derivative, 
shackled.” It 
was concerned not with the 
covery of new principles of pol- 
the formulation of new 
policies but with protecting the 
from the Fathers of 
the Republic, the inheritance of 
the Golden Age. It was prac- 
ticed in an era of change, in an 
atmosphere of unrest and dan- 
ger, “when the very foundations 
of the social order seemed to be 
dissolving and flowing away.” In 
many and important respects this 
was similar to our own, and

to avoid the suspicion that they

the drama engage his special in-

the formulation of a Latin-Amer-

OBERT LORAINE was a 
k celebrated actor, a pioneer 

aviator and a soldier in 
two wars. He also was one of the 
first men of the theatre to 
the financial risk of producing a 
play by George Bernard Shaw 
and he became Shaw's 
friend He was, moreover, a 
headstrong, restless, undisciplined 
and devil-may-care soldier of 
fortune, who steps like a figure

He ran away from school at 
the age of 13 and got a job in 
the lowest ranks of his father’s 
profession, as an actor. Some 
years later Shaw was to describe 
him, in a summary quoted here, 
as “one of those curious people 
whom you meet on the stage who 
was hereditarily an actor. The

a new exposition, at length, of the 
doctrines of Mahanism, the spe- 
cific application of the lessons 
that Mahan taught to the prob- 
lems of today, would have made 
this book an even more welcome 
addition to the library of impor- 
tant volumes dealing with things 
of the sea 

We have a hint of what might 
had Captain Puleston 
when 


have been 
chosen to expand his book 
he writes 
Mahan always hailed the ad- 
vent of a new weapon. * * * 
Today, every advantage Mahan 
proved for sea power will be 
doubly assured by a fleet with 
a properly integrated air force. 
* * * The value of Mahan’s 


writings to statesmen, military, 

naval and air officers will still 

persist even if air power should 

prove itself the occasional neu- 

tralizer and eventually the con- 

tinuous master of sea power. 
Here indeed is a hint of her- 

esy, coming as it does from an 

old-line naval officer, and yet 

one not hide-bound by past tra- 

dition, one fortunately broad 

enough to understand that the 

shape of things to come may 

not follow the pattern of the 

past. * * * Mahan knew that 

changes in tactics very soon af- 

fect strategy. * * * He would 

not have confined his specula- 

tion to the effect of aviation on 

naval strategy. He would have 

followed the idea further and 

considered the future effect of 

aviation upon the policies of the 

great powers. * * * Not until 

political aggregations of men, 

whether known as Soviets, re- 

publics, National Socialists, 

monarchies, empires or Fas- 

cists, cease to strive for power 

and their own advantage will 

Mahan’s writings  be- 

come obsolete. Mahan 

recited the glory of Brit- 

ain’s sea power and 

world dominion. He saw 

that the United States 

had all the elements 

necessary to even great- 

er expansion, and he 

never ceased to regret 

that after the Civil War 

preoccupation with set- 

tling the interior caused 

it temporarily to aban- 

don its overseas heri- 

tage. He knew that its 

unassailable position fac- 

ing both oceans, unvexed 

by powerful neighbors, 

would give it an oppor- 

tunity to excel Great 

Britain at the peak of 

her greatest power. And 

his prophecy is the more 

interesting in view of 

contemporary develop- 

ments in the submarine 

and airplane that leave 

the United States today

cure from all but spo- 

radic attacks by these

from the jungle of Northern

There is, often, an

general tenor of the book is 
frankly laudatory; and there are 
many who would have preferred 
to see a study of Mahan’s works 
painted against a broader canvas 
than is here done. 


What, for instance, has the 
philosophy that is Mahanism con- 
tributed to the world? Professor 
Beard and Louis Hacker would 
certainly differ from Captain 
Puleston in their evaluation of 
Mahan’s worth; while there is 
room for such differences of opin- 
ion, the author might have con- 
tributed by facing such criticism 

a@ more balanced study of Ma-

the great naval writer was not

Good enough, but not, of itself, 
sufficient to explain the strength 
of the book's intellectual appeal, 
which derives directly from the 
characterization. There is no un- 
wieldy crowd of people, and, be- 
cause of the easy artistry of their 
presentation, they seem fewer in 
number than they are. You have 
to add them up at the end to 
discover that at least a score of 
characters have been unforget- 
tably limned. But it is the cen- 
tral figure that makes this a 
novel that, if staged, would de- 
mand a great comedienne in the 
single star role 

If all the 
heroines in fiction were lined up 
for Lorna Blake 


great 


comparison

would stand uncommonly 
good chance of being bracketed 
with those at the top. She does 
burst upon us. She is un- 
unfolds herself——with 
the gradualness of the coming to 
bloom of a once-in-a-century blos- 
an attractive 


an 


not 
tolded——or 


som insidiously 


evil blossom. 


You meet her first as the ap- 
parently widowed and 
incomed young London mother of 
two growing girls, and mistress 
of Susan, whom she had rescued 
trom village “tartdom"” and at- 
tached to herself as maid-of-all- 
work, lady's maid and shrewdly 
caustic and irrepressible commen- 
tator. Then, at the seaside, a de- 
voted parent bent on giving her 
two “little crumpets,” as she af- 
fectionately calls them, “a per- 
fect childhood,” and bored to the 
soul in doing it. Suddenly, out of 
a clear sky, storm. She has been 
working up, as did the Matriarch, 
for a “bad time.” But it is only 
in the periodicity of her outbursts 
and in her tremendous vitality 
and gusto for living that she is 
like the grand old girl of the 
Rakonitz family 

She is the “woman in the hall, 
madam,” making it her ingrati- 
ating business to get past butlers 
and secretaries and governesses 

though preferably not gov- 
ernesses, whom she loathes since 
one unmasked her—to lure cash 
and checks from carefully se- 
lected victims to finance some 
supposedly meritorious and piti- 
ful purpose; but, actually, to pro- 
vide herself and her children with 
temporary color and spaciousness 
and excitement. Then a “good” 
even, afterward, when the 


meager- 


time 


small income must suffice; until 
the gambling blood she got from 
her mother again takes charge. 
Later she gives up the increasing 
hazard of personal appeals for 
the begging-letter racket. Sensa- 
tional this; but it is 
backed by psychological insight 
and used with consummate skill 
in the delineation of character 
and the portrayal of personality. 
Lorna is a crook who might have 
been a great woman but for the 
kink in her mental make-up 


material 


Miss Stern-is perfect mistress 
of the “deferred” method of 
narration. This is one of the 
ways in which the novel scores 
over the stage. On page 75, for 
instance, we read of the fascina- 
tion of Lorna’s “attractive husky 
voice * * * and sudden radiant 
smile” that won over Sylvia 
Mainwaring, the society girl who 
jilted her fiancé and was the 
occasion, later, of his death be- 
cause of Lorna; but it is not till 
page 332 that we hear of the 
“subtle dimples” that worked 
such havoc on Sir Halmar Bar- 
nard, of her wealthy vic- 
tims, whom she hoodwinked and 
married and to whom she made 
an excellent wife—while it lasted 

The deferred method is used 
too with signal effectiveness in 
showing us Lorna’s past, dug up 
by Syivia’s furious lover and 
bringing to light in its train both 
the Neil Inglefield, who Lorna in- 
had married and deserted 
her, Shirley Dennison, the 
charming woman happi- 
ness Lorna had deliberately and 
calculatingly wrecked when they 
were girls; as well as introducing 
the Leonard Blake whose

name Lorna usually assumed. It 
is a method which, in the hands 
of a literary artist of Miss 
Stern's finesse, keeps interest 
a-boiling, provides perpetual sur- 
prises and excitement and builds 
up the story by logical accretions 
to a triumphal finale 

In dramatic contrast with 
blazoned career is what 
Shirley referred to once as the 
“nightmare childhood” of Molly 


and Jay, the two girls who get 
taken round, in clothes of spe-

If there is a criticism of this 
excellent book, it is that Dorothy 
Parker too often uses the same 
themes and the same situations 
There is more than one story 
about a girl who is desperately 
clinging to a man she knows she 
has lost and about a marriage 
which goes on the rocks for no 
apparent reason. However, in the 
opinion of this reviewer, this 
volume shows more clearly than 
ever before that Dorothy Parker 
is not only a scintillating epigram- 
matist but the creator of sketches 
which will be remembered long 
after many more _ pretentious 
writings have been forgotten.

justice with which this difficult 
task is accomplished fill the 
reader with admiration. 

The work is divided into two 


parts, of unequal size but of equal 
importance and interest. Part I, 
Discovery and Conquest to In- 
dependence,” contains Chapters I 
to XII, inclusive, 120 pages. Part 
Il, “The Independent States of 
Latin America,” contains Chap- 
XIII to XXXIV, inclusive, 
being the rest of the book 

Part I covers more than three 
centuries of time in a and 
highly diversified portion of the 
New World wherein Spain and 
Portugal established and main- 
tained their overseas dominions. 
The first three chapters tell us of 
the discovered and of the 
setting up therein of European 
rule. Chapters IV and V deal, 
respectively, with the Spanish- 
governed regions and with Portu- 
guese Brazil. In Chapters VI to 
XII, inclusive, we are told of the

The stirring story is told bril-

of the independence movement,

The Creoles were politically im- 
potent. As a result of these con- 
ditions there burned in the 
breasts of many Creoles a fierce 
desire to be free; and, in Mexico 
Peru and elsewhere, it was chief- 
ly the Creoles who led the way 
to independence. Mr. Kirkpat- 
rick recognizes this truth in other 
parts of his book, notably in 
Chapter VIII, where Mexican in- 
dependence is discussed. 

Particularly admirable is the 
manner in which the career of 
Bolivar, working southward from 
Venezuela to Peru, and that of 
San Martin, working northward 
from Argentina and Chile, are 
described. The two great leaders 

both, incidentally, Creole aris- 
tocrats-——held very different views 
as to the church and as to polit- 
ical methods. When they met at 
Guayaquil in July, 1822, they 
could not agree. San Martin, 
protector of Peru, generously of- 
fered to serve under Bolivar; 
but, when this offer came to 
naught, he finally departed from 
Peru, making way for the com- 
ing of Bolivar to Lima. There 
Bolivar established a short-lived 
dictatorship which was a prelude 
to tumultuous national independ- 
ence after his departure north- 
ward.

gained independence was unique

What Is Involved 


You are not obliged, as a member of 
the Club, to take the book-of-the-month

misapprehension arising from our name 
are you obliged to buy one book every 
month from the Club. Here is the simple 
system 

Publishers submit all their important 
books to us. These go through the most 
careful reading routine now in existence 
It is not unusual for a single book to be 
read by nine different preliminary read

The Principles of Sculpture 


SCULPTURE INSIDE AND

With 276 illustrations. 330 pp. 
New York: W. W. Norton & 
Co. $3.75 

By DINO FERRARI 
ALVINA HOFFMAN 
hardly needs an _ intro- 
duction. Since her stu- 
dent days in Paris under 

Rodin she has won academic rec- 
from the French Gov- 
many a national 
award here in her own country 
for her work in sculpture. She 
later buttressed this reputation 
by her medical drawings, ana- 
tomical studies and specimen re- 
constructions done for medical 
schools and museums of natural 
history. Her extensive travels 
and her own art work have 
brought her not only many 

a valued friendship with 

prominent men of art, 

thought and _ science 

whose influence, she grate- 

fully acknowledges, has 

contributed greatly to her 

own artistic and intellec- 

tual development—-but also 

a variety of experience 

and knowledge which has 

broadened her vision of 

life and deepened her un- 

derstanding of art. 
However, if memory 

serves us right in gauging 

her artistic career, it was 

not until she undertook to 

do the gigantic Hall of 

Man, with its one hun- 

dred bronzes making up 

the “Races of Man,” for 

the Field Museum of Chi- 

cago that she hit the 

high-water mark in popu- 

larity, if not exactly in in- 

trinsic artistic achieve- 

ment. The story of that 

work, which ‘took five 

years to complete and led 

her to the remote corners 

of the globe in search of racial 

types,” was told by Miss Hoff- 

man in her widely read ‘Heads 
and Tales."’ As she herself can- 
didly says at the end of her pres- 
ent book, what prompted her to 
write “Sculpture Inside and 

Out” has been the large number 

of letters from students asking 

her professional advice since the 
publication of “Heads and Tales.” 

Otherwise, she continues, “I 

should never have embarked on

This effort has brought me

little more than a corner of the 
veil, but I've tried, and in so do 
ing hope the result may not be 
entirely useless. I feel very ex- 
hausted, and very, very small 

But while this effort may have 
left Miss Hoffman 
and very, very small,” “Sculpture 
Inside and Out” is far from ex- 
hausting, and certainly not a 
“small” undertaking Far from 
it. In fact, judging from the vast 
field, or fields, Miss Hoffman has 
sought to encompass within~the

grams and photographs showing 
the various steps whereby stone, 
clay and bronze are converted by 
artist and craftsman into a work 
of art. Of the two sections, it 


seems to me, the second one, 
dealing mainly with the craft and 
tools of that art, is by far the 
instructive and thorough- 
going of the two. Here her tech-

Hoffman attempts to 
many phases of art, which, while 
certainly related to each other in 
the scheme of art values and of 
art activities, to do them full jus-

length treatment. This section 
suffers from a wealth of ideas 
about art which, while intriguing 
and stimulating in themselves, 
yet suffer from a lack of formal 
sustaining thought and schematic 
values

mean to imply that the first part 
of “Sculpture Out”

tribution to the art 
sculpture. On the contrary, there 
is in this section one brief chap- 
ter—if we can dignify it by the 


term chapter (it may, with more 


propriety, be called a heading) 
of exactly one 
pages on the “Origin of Form,” 


and a quarter 


wherein she advances the novel 


and fascinating idea that the em- 
bryonic beginning of 
form lies in the egg 


If we study the position of 
the fetus as it appears in about 
the ninth month of its develop- 
ment we see the tiny body 
curled up with its head bowed 
over, the hands crossed, and 
the knees drawn up to permit 
the whole structure of 
muscles, nerves and arteries to 
fit comfortably into the cage 
of the matrix. As it was in the 
beginning, so it is again at the 
end of life. Think of the de- 
crepit old human being, bent 
over, head bowed, seated in a 
weary, curled-up position ex- 
actly similar to the unborn 
babe’s. The cycle of life begins 

and ends in the same 
design; only the propor- 
tion, size and shape of 
the human being change 
as he passes through 
the stages of babyhood, 
youth, maturity and old 
age. The eternal oval, 
the egg itself. 


Or take this bit of ad- 
vice, chosen at random, to 
future sculptors: 

Sculpture cannot be 
taught by books or the 
spoken word; it must be 
experienced by the art- 
ist. Art is a command 
The hands must be 
trained by practice, the 
mind by constant ac- 
quisition of knowledge, 
and the heart by its un- 
defeated faith and de- 
Sire to overcome all ob- 
Stacles. For sculpture 
is a thorny road beset 
by barriers, defeats and 
disappointments

London where, at a dinner he 


had an illuminating conversation 


with Sir John Simon, who, with 
others, plied him with questions 
about Wilson. Finally Simon 
alarmed him with the comment 
“You sound like a carefully pre 
pared legal brief, written by an 


American lawyer, which points 


out all of Wilson's weaknesses 
and tells how they can be played 


upon and utilized. It is being cir- 


culated among our peace dele- 
gates for their edification.” Vil- 
lard wondered “if anybody was 


coaching Wilson as to the weak- 


nesses of his coming adversar- 


ies,’ and he wondered who the 
American lawyer couid be. He 
thought of James M. Beck, but 


he “absolutely denied any knowl 
edge of any such document.” If 
one existed its authorship would 


throw a light on the intrigues 


against Wilson by his country 
men, when he was entitled to 
their cooperation 

Villard had warmly favored 
Wilson's going to Europe and he 
followed him to Manchester 
where he thought the great 
throng might easily have “gone 


down on their Knees before him.” 


As an observer and reporter at 
the peace Congress he was to 
conclude that it would have been

York: Doubleday, Doran 4 Co 
$2.50. 
HIS book is 
its jacket as “a gay Bae- 
deker of New York,” and 
that phrase is worth quot- 
ing because it sums up everything 
that the 400-page volume claims, 
or tries, to be. It is “the only book 
of its kind authorized by the 
World's Fair,” and it is essen- 
tially a guide book for World's

second paragraph, when she de- 
scribes this metropolis as “a 
city which has become one of the 
most fascinating in the world, 
which contains in it whatever 
you may be looking for, whether 
it be a restaurant where 
you can take your best girl for a 
glamorous 


good 


65-cent dinner or a 
night club where the sky is the 
limit.” And she begins the main 
body of her text after an initial 


chapter on the World's Fair 
itself, “Broadway plunges you 
headlong into a good time. You'll 
still) find more of a _ carnival 
spirit there than in any other 
part of the city.” 

The entire book is not given 


over to the Broadway or night- 
club type of good time, of course. 
Indeed, Miss Worden follows her 
theatre chapter with one on the 
Fire Department (‘the watch- 
dog of the theatres’’), and, simi- 


larly, introduces the Police De- 
partment and its work at the 
close of her survey of night 


clubs. After her chapter on the 
most expensive restaurants she 
guides her readers interestingly 
to the Department of Markets 
and an interview with its Com- 
missioner. And she has a chap- 
ter on music, one on art gal- 
leries and museums, one on 
churches and one on parks. Some 
of her most attractive material is 
in her suggestions visits to 
the city’s various foreign quar- 
ters, to shops which sell unusual 
things and to a miscellany of 
more or less self-contained neigh- 
borhoods, from Chelsea to Co- 
lumbia University. 

By and large, however, it is 
the sense of happy holiday and 
“the carnival spirit” which ani- 
mates Miss Worden’s researches. 
Her book is slapdash and not in- 
variably accurate, but it is both 
entertaining and hospitable and 
should aid in our visitors’ enjoy- 
ment. Grover Whalen contributes 
a brief foreword.

Galleons of Spain 


THE MANILA GALLEON. By 
William Lytle Schurz. With 
Maps and Charts. 453 pp. New 
York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $6. 

EARLY, for two and a half 
centuries, the Spanish gal- 
leons made the lonely, dan- 

gerous but richly remunerative 
voyage between the fabulous 
trading port of Manila and Aca- 
pulco in Mexico. Their journey 
was the longest continuous navi- 
gation in the world (the east- 
bound voyage took from five to 
seven months in the seventeenth 


century, and even by the nine- 
teenth century few crossings 
lasted less than four months), 


and they were beset by pirates 
and privateers as well as by all 
the perils of the sea. Behind 
their trading operations, more- 
over, stood a proverbially unmer- 
cantile people and a colony that 
never did put down successful 
roots for progressive life and per- 
self-maintenance, And 
yet no line of ships has 
ever endured so long And the 
whole story of the Manila gal- 
leons, told here by an American 
scholar after twenty-seven years 
of exhaustive study, is as fasci- 


manent 
other 


nating as it is strange, pic- 
turesque and amazing.

the last ship put into port in 1815 
it was already five years since 
Mexico had begun its revolt 
against Spain. And when the 
Spaniards occupied California in 
1769 the two-century-old need for 
a ships’ way-station was part of

AS THE PINES GROW By 
Evelyn Voss Wise. 256 pp. Neu

Company. $2 
HERE can be no question of 
Mrs. Wise’s intimate love of 
the Minnesota farm lands, 
for it permeates every page of 
her new book as it did her first 
novel, “The Long Tomorrow.” A 
farm boy of unusual heritage and 
caliber is the hero of this, her 
second. By starting out with him 
13 years old, in 1910, she is able 
to show his development in the 
days of happy peace, during the 
wartime, and in maturity after 
the war, the last phase being in 
dicated briefly 
The boy’s passionate devotion 
to the farm and his haughty fa- 
ther’s efforts to make a ‘gentle 
man” of him cause a conflict that 
means more to the boy than any 
thing else. Farm work is life it 
and college is but a 
girls 
are puzzling and important but

step to better farm work, 
not essential, army life is inter 


esting but easily mastered, and 
even politics in the little home

until they touch his land and his 
people

Edited by Alfred O. Mendel.) 
New York: Longmans, Green €& 
Co. $1 per vol. 


By JOHN COURNOS 


T would be hard to conceive 


of a more salutary, praise- 
worthy and seasonable enter- 
prise than this project of a 
Living Thoughts Library, of which 


the four small volumes listed here 


form only a preliminary to a host 
of volumes yet to come. Welcome 
at any time, these eloquent wit- 
nesses of the best intelligences of 
past eras are manifoldly welcome 
in this our own time, an era of 
rampant unreason and anarchic 
criteria. It is clear that the editor 
of the series, Mr. Alfred O. 
Mendel, uses the phrase “Living 
Thoughts” in a very real, very 
precise sense. They are living 
not merely because they have 
the enduring, undying quality of 


noble thought; they are living 
also, and chiefly, because they 


still have the virtue of being en- 
dowed with some eternal truth 


which stirs us deeply at this day, 


with perhaps an intensified mean- 
ing, sharpened because we live 
in a period of crises and have 


greater need of the sanity which 


only great and noble thinkers can 
They provide an answer, it 
may be called an antidote, to 
purveyors of current nostrums, 
propagandists, 
ture-wreckers, and all the Shirts, 
be they Red, Black or Brown, to 
say nothing of the Stuffed ones. 

The plan of the 
simple yet comprehensive. What 
is best, characteristic and 
most essential in the philosophy 
of a thinker of the past is chosen 
by a thinker or creative mind of 
the present sympathetic to the 
particular philosophy, and this 
material, thus wisely selected by 
one who knows, understands and 
loves the object of his choice, is 
interpreted by him in a prefatory 
essay, which presents the gist and 
the meaning of the philosophy, 


with especial stress on its signif- 
icance for our own time. More 


than that the spiritual ante- 
cedents of each figure are given, 
as well as the spiritual progeny 
to whom his mind has helped to 
give birth. 
Thus, the

by eliminating the needs created 
by him. Thoreau, says Dreiser, 
“felt that material reform would 


never be accomplished without 


an inward and individual reform 


first, and that if this last were 
accomplished, then the former 
would be superfluous!"’ To illus- 
trate his thesis, Dreiser has 


chosen long extracts from “A

Rivers,”” ‘“‘Walden,” ‘‘Famil- 
and “Journals.”’

However 
great men meet at some points. 
Thus, Stefan Zweig indicates that 
Tolstoi, like Thoreau, preached 
“revolution from within, revolu- 
tion not of the mailed fist but of 
a conscience unshakable and 
ready for any suffering—-a revo- 
lution of souls, not of fists.” Like 


Thoreau, he was definitely ‘“anti- 


State.” Yet, oddly enough, Tol- 
stoi’s ideas provided food for the 
enemy as well as for ‘“Tolstoians.”’ 


For is it not strange, Zweig asks, 
that Tolstoi, to whom nothing 
could have been more foreign 
than systematic bolshevism, 


“which began by the crushing of 
its enemy (while he demanded 


conciliation through love); which 
gave the State—the Beelzebub of 


Tolstoi—-an undreamt-of author- 
ity over the individual,’ should 
have smoothed the path so much 
for Lenin and Trotsky? At the 
same time, even while the Rus- 
sians appropriated the radical, 
the destructive side of Tolstoi’s 


teaching, in India the non-Chris- 
tian Gandhi “took over the apos- 
tolate of primitive Christianity, 
* the doctrine of non-resist- 
ance, and was the first, with his

HE Encyclopaedia Britanni- 

T eca’s “Record of the March 

of Events of 1938” begins 
its text with a calendar of the 


year’s occurrences. But the thun- 
derous keynote of 1938 has been 
clearly struck before that: the 


quarto frontispiece 
shows in the center a gas-masked 
civilian descending into a shelter- 


volume’s 


hole, while soldiers and war equip 
ment surround three sides of the 
picture and a photograph of the 
fateful Quartet of Munich is re- 
produced above. The article on 
Europe is prefaced with the in- 
evitable summary: “The year 
1938 was the most dramatic and 
most momentous in European 
history since 1918." And one’s 
attention turns almost involun- 
tarily to such titles as “‘Muni- 
tions of War,” “Air Forces’ and 
“Chemical Warfare.” 

The Encyclopaedia Yearbook is 
naturally, however, a comprehen- 
sive survey of the events of 1938 
in all quarters of the globe and 
all departments of life——literally

eloquent essay will have the ef- 
fect of impelling the reader to 
read the whole of it. 

One cannot be too grateful to 


Thomas Mann for selecting as his 
contribution the essence of Scho- 


penhauer’s thought from “The 
World as Will and Idea.” The 
book from which the extracts 
are taken is of too abstractly 


philosophical a nature to appeal 


to the average reader, and in this 
instance Mr. Mann’s exposition 
should be of great service in ac- 
quainting him with the meaning 
of this important work, whose 
philosophy, Mann holds, “may 
still exert a ripe and humanizing 
influence upon our age.” 

I have left the Montaigne vol- 
ume for the last. It may be that 
my own weakness for this father 


of “liberalism,” this “sworn en- 
emy to all falsifications’” (his 
own words), predisposes me to 


speak of this volume as the ex- 
emplar of what all the volumes 


of the series should be. Not only 
are the essays Gide has selected 
very representative, but his own 


introductory essay is a model of 
exposition, of terseness and preci- 


sion; in the end a_ portrait 
emerges, remarkably complete, 
considering the economy em- 


ployed, and stimulates an inter- 
est and sympathy which must in- 
evitably drive the reader to Mon- 
taigne. “What Montaigne teaches 
us especially,” says Gide, “is 
what was called at a much later 


date liberalism, and I think it is 
the lesson that can 
drawn from him at the present 
time when political 
convictions are 
viding all men and opposing them 
to each other.”

projected for this year, and oth-

that they will receive the large 


welcome they deserve.

3ut, turning to the second half 
of his tale, the author—as if sud- 
denly bewitched by the sprites 
and imps who lurk behind that 
word “Vienna’’—abruptly changes 
his tone. Now one gets, in heap- 
ing measure, the feel of that city 
unique among cities; its inde- 
scribable blend of depth and solid- 
ity and substance happily wedded 
to light-heartedness and _ the 
ecstasy of life for life’s sake

roaring in the streets of his be- 
loved city, exclaimed: “Wife, do 
you know what I would like 
above all things? I long like a 
child to hear a little good music 
again.” 

Always, the author points out, 
that contradictory metropolis was 
a place of light and shadow; all 
through its long history insensate 
cruelties were perpetrated within 
its walls; and, long before the 
Nazis poured in from the cold 


north to rob Vienna of mirth and

Even the haughty scions of the 
House of Habsburg responded at 
times to her witchery; indeed, the

Rudolf, he whose death fifty 
years ago by the side of his beau- 
tiful young sweetheart remains 
one of the most poignant of royal 
mysteries, was essentially Vien- 
nese in soul as well as body. And, 
once at least, impish Vienna 
touched even Rudolf’s father, eti- 
quette-bound, convention-ridden 
old Emperor Franz Josef, with 
her magic wand. That was when, 
at Rudolf’s wedding, the Viennese 
crowd, 
lines, surged dangerously against 
the Emperor’s frail carriage. In- 
stead of yielding to imperial anger 
or human Franz Josef 
stood up, smiling, and addressed 
to his milling subjects this genu- 
inely “Wiener” admonition: “But,

And so the great city goes 
upon her untried way. Cultiva 
tion, grace, delicacy, refine- 
ment, a fostered childhood of 
music and slow time give way 
to all that the swastika stands 
for. There may well be eco- 
nomic betterment; the Treaty 
of Saint-Germain left the im-

it poverty-stricken. * * * The

Mozart, Schubert, Strauss had

felicity, and sent the Danube

Yet—-is there not one ray of 
hope? Are not those who knew 
and loved the old Vienna——who 
love her still and still think they 
know her justified in not yield

that Mr. Sedgwick, in consigning 
the city of light and light-heart-

of premature burial? Can any

THE MUSSOLINI MURDER PLOT. By 
Berrard Newman, 282 pp. New 
York: Hillman-Curl. $2 
The moral of this book, if it 

has one, is that dictators should 

not be assassinated lest they be- 
come more dangerous in death 
than they were in life. It deals 
with the doings of an imaginary 
League of International Amity, 
whose purpose is to prevent war 
by executing those who threaten 
to make it. This league has sent 
warnings to the rulers of various 
countries, and particularly, to 

Mussolini, who is just about to 

take Abyssinia. An Englishman, 


who takes these warnings more 


seriously than do the persons to 
whom they are addressed, deter- 
mines to find out what plans the 
league has and, above all, to pre- 
vent the assassination of Il Duce 
The story deals with his adven- 
tures while engaged upon this 
self-appointed mission. Although 
the incidents narrated are wildly 
improbable, the author has suc 
ceeded in creating an illusion of 
reality. There is very little mys- 
tery in the story, but there are 
thrills in abundance. It would 
have been more in accordance 
with good taste, however, if the 
fictional character of the book 
had been emphasized by using 
the name of an imaginary dicta 
tor of a country not found on the 
map 


THE GHOST ON THE BALCONY. By 
Dwight Marfield. 279 pp. New 
York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $2 
Wily Orientals, forbidden drugs 

and murders galore— these should 
be enough material for a mystery 
yarn. In addition we have a bell 
that tolls announcing death be- 
fore those whose office it is to 
ring the bell know that death has 
taken place. The puzzle of who 
killed whom and why is cleared 
up after a fashion, but the author 
never does get around to explain 
ing the tolling of the bell. Not 
that it matters much His ex- 
planation might have made the 
story even worse than it is

A. 8S. McCormick of Akron 
presses surprise at “such igno-

Let me also admit my unwilling-

temporary accounts, any state- 
ment made in a general history 
as to the failure of the master of 
an early steamship to make pru-

on a long ocean voyage. Not 
only am I anxious to settle the 
question of whether or not the 
Royal William used sail on her 
famous transatlantic voyage but 
also to determine the true date 
of her departure, Mr. McCor- 
mick having learned from the 
“Chronicles” that it was Aug.

D’avenant’s Life 

Editor Tae New York Times Book Review 

May I respond to Mr. Percy 
Hutchison’s indirect invitation 
that I, the author, enter into the 
scholarly hostilities in which he, 
Charles Wisner Barrell and Erma 
R. Gebhardt have become _ in- 
volved in connection with his 
kind review of my book on Sir 
William D’avenant? After read- 
ing their letters and re-examin- 
ing the original review with re- 
newed interest I have come to 
the conclusion that the whole 
teapot tempest could have been 
avoided if they had all read my 
book with the proper amount of 
care, for I believe that I have 
dealt reliably there with all the 
points in dispute. Certainly I am 
grateful that none of them has 
called any of my own statements 
to account. 

As for Mr. Barrell's first 


charge that Mr Hutchison 


styles D’avenant “Shakespeare's 
godson”.—-I myself refer to the 
matter as a “universally ac- 


cepted tradition.” I now see that 


I should have written of it as a 


“virtually universally accepted 
tradition,” for which any one 
can demonstrate a continuous 


history back into the seventeenth 


century. But I find no evidence 
that “this myth has been dis- 
carded” any more than has 


“Aubrey’s scandalous story that 


attributed D’avenant’s paternity 


Editor 


to the bard.” I am afraid that 
Mr. Barrell belongs among the 
Bardolaters, to whom I pay my 


respects on page 7 of my book 
In the second place, Mr. Bar- 
rell is bothered by Mr. Hutchi- 
son's statement that Sir Fulke 
Greville had been Shakespeare's 
friend, and challenges him for 
proof, “for it would be of very 


great interest to thousands of 
persons in this country and 
abroad who have searched the 


Shakespearean biographical trail 
very keenly indeed.” Such a keen 
search, I should have expected, 


would have acquainted them | 
with, for instance, Thomas Whit- 
field Baldwin's “The Organiza- 


tion and Personnel of the Shake- 
spearean Company” (Princeton 
University Press, 1927), where | 
on page 291 they would have 
found a summary of all the evi- | 
dence, citing such authorities as | 
Edmond Malone, Mrs. C. C. 
Stopes, Joseph Quincy Adams 
and J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps. | 


These, at least, are the slender 
reeds on which I depended for | 
support when I made the re- 
marks whereon Mr. Hutchison 


based his statement 

As for the last point, the ap- 
pearance of actresses in the Eng- | 
lish public theatre, Erma Geb- 
hardt has lucidly pointed out the

ment when she insists on the dis- |

"A collective nightmare, sprung directly

| quintessence of lunacy than any living 
person.

HIS BIG, NEW BOOK Is A COMPLETE GUIDE FOR 
PROSPECTIVE HOME OWNERS—FULL DETAILS OF FLOOR 


PLANS, INTERIORS, MATERIALS, COSTS, OF 144 HOUSES 


Fy ovens an a home of your own is now not so much a question of how much—but how 


soon! Architectural and building experience, with new methods and materials, are at 
their peaks. Cheaper mortgage money is at your disposal. That is why more and more 
‘Americans are embarking on this greatest of all adventures. Of course, costs vary for differ- 


ent localities—but reliable economists have shown that any family in normal circumstances 
can safely afford to spend up to TWICE its yearly income for a house and lot. 
















And now the Editors of Architectural Forum, published by Time, Inc., and the leading 


publication in the building field, offer you every assist- 
ance—from before you choose your lot until the time 
you finally move into your home. And they chart for 
you, in hundreds of photographs and diagrams, the 


experiences of 144 home-builders the country over, on 
which to pattern your own plans.

FOCAL EXHIBIT: Without 
production there obviously would 


not be much distribution; and 
without distribution, consump-

feur sections The first, told 
largely in motion pictures—which 
give a “four-aimensional” effect 


and accompanied by music and 
narration, is devoted to the man- 


ner in which men, science, ma- 


chines and money produce con- 


sumer goods. A housewife orders

WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC 
AND MANUFACTURING COM- 
PANY: Will today’s civilization 
have vanished in the dust fifty 
centuries hence? If so, there 
may be an archaeologist of that 
remote day who will probe in the 
soil of what is now the World's 
Fair grounds and unearth the 
Time Capsule, a receptacle con- 
taining records of what is hap- 
pening today. The Time Capsule 
is buried beneath the Westing- 
house Building. In that building 
are displays of electrical wonders 
described for posterity, modern 
wonders for modern explorers, 
which show by chart, diagram, 
diorama, motion pictures and ex- 
ample how electrical energy and 
appliances make life easier. 

There are also trick gadgets 
for the visitor to work, including

Transportation 


FOCAL EXHIBIT: The whole 
dramaof transportationissummed 
up in this focal exhibit, situated 
in one hali of the Chrysler Build- 
ing In designing it, Raymond 
Loewy sought to show the story 
of man's progress from the foot- 
path to the stratosphere. History 
is dramatized by a huge map 
with flashing lights which chart 
the changes in man’s speed, from 
the days of sandal-clad runners 
through the time of galley ships, 
camels, chariots, covered wagons, 
stage coaches, the pony express 
and the clipper ship. Finally the 
railroad, the steamship, the auto- 
mobile and the airplane are called 
on to show how man can now cir- 
cle the globe in a few days. The 
climax is the departure of a rock- 
etship from a rocket port of the 
future Here vith startling ef- 
fects of light, speed, sound and 
distance, a rocket-ship is loaded 
into a gigantic gun and launched 
into the night, to go winging into 
the vast reaches of the sky to- 
ward London. Special item: The 
models of tomorrow’s motor ve- 
hicles. (E-13) 


CHRYSLER MOTOR COM- 
PANY: If Lady Godiva had used 
an automobile instead of a horse 
she wouldn't have got sunburned. 
Or maybe she didn’t. Anyway, 
the Chrysler exhibit takes up the 
matter and rectifies it, with due 
consideration for the lady’s epi- 
dermis. By using illusion boxes-— 
combinations of big dioramas, 
lights and transparent mirrors 
a number of historical characters, 
including Lady Godiva, George 
Washington and Buffalo Bill, are 
shown changing from primitive 
conveyances to the latest model 
Chrysler cars. The whole Chrys- 
ler show is dedicated to fun and 
illusion. Theres’ a “psychic car,’ 
with mysterious remote control, 
which can answer questions and 
go through a mystic routine 
There are three-dimensional mo- 
vies with polaroid spectacles for 
the audience. There are scientific 
gadgets and laboratory wonders. 
There's a “frozen forest,” a grove 
of palm trees made of sheet met- 
al and containing refrigeration 
units which keep them coated 
with frost And, of course, there 
are displays of Chrysler automo- 
biles and trucks and such other 
Chrysler products as air-condi- 
tioning equipment. Special item 
The polarized mural, with the il 
lusion of constant motion. (E-138) 


COURT OF RAILWAYS: The 


THE FAIR'S 


old and the new of railroading 
meet here in a sixteen-acre dis- 
play of locomotives, trains and 
the men who make them run 
Twenty-seven principal roads 
east of the Mississippi are par 
ticipating and there are three 
and a half miles of track and 
enough special exhibits to make 
one's head swim. In the yards 
stands the British-built John Bull 
locomotive of 1831 alongside a 
modern 140-foot Pennsylvania 
giant that runs continuously at 
sixty miles an hour on a roiler 
bed. Near by are crack European 
trains, American streamiliners 
and venerable wood-burners with 
bulging stacks. On an outdoor 
Stage the drama, “Railroads on 


Parade,” (admission 25 cents) is 
enacted with a cast of 250 actors. 
This is a pageant of American 
transportation with a background 
of covered wagons, early trains 
and modern locomotives Be 
neath the eight-story dome of the 
main building are miniature men 
in a cyclorama of railroad build 
ing, clearing right-of-way, felling 
trees, mining ore, assembling 
trains. “Railroads at Work,” 
(admission 10 cents) is a toy- 
train dreamland with 500 minia- 
ture locomotives and cars plying 
3,800 feet of “O” gauge track 
through a diorama of cities, 
towns, farmland and country- 
side. There are also exhibits of 
many railroad material and sup- 
ply companies, but once the visi- 
tor gets enmeshed in this insidi- 
ous world of rails and locomotives 
he'll need no further guidance. 
Special item: The old-time loco- 
motives, the kind that scared 
grandpa’s prize surrey team half 
out of their wits. (B-13) 
FIRESTONE RUBBER COM

crudely vulcanized rubber. And

rubber from cradle to grave. The 
Firestone exhibit, not content 
with a modern tire factory that 
turns out a finished automobile 
tire every four minutes, also in- 
cludes a farm complete with 
house, barns, pigs and chickens. 
For rubber has gone rural. All 
the farm vehicles are equipped 
with rubber tires, and one half 
expects to see the chickens in 
rubber boots—-but they aren't, 
The tire factory is equipped with 
a battery of streamlined, chromi- 
um-finished machines and shows 
the whole process, from crude 
rubber to a tire ready to go ona 
wheel. There are also gardens, 
fountains, a diorama of a Liberi- 
an rubber plantation and an ex- 
hibit of Firestone products. Spe- 
cial item: The ducks along the 
real stream in the farmyard.

FORD MOTOR COMPANY: 
Automobiles don’t just grow in 
a factory; they are made of ma- 
terials that come from all over 
the world, The Ford Exposition 
is keyed to this fact, and its cen- 
tral display is the “Cycle of Pro- 
duction” which shows how raw 
materials are turned into finished 
automobiles. On a huge turntable 
there are more than 100 animated 
puppets going through the mo-

You.want good clothes at prices you can afford to pay. And that 


is where Best’s shines. 


We run our business as simply and economically as possible. Our 


‘ , ; ; 6“ ” 
prices do not have to include a high cover charge for “atmosphere, 
nor the cost of overexpansion of ground or plant. Oo0r service is 
streamlined to eliminate the non-essentials that add so heavily to 
expenses. Our operating policy is based on merit—with no “dead 


wood” or nepotism anywhere in the organization. 


WE HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR QUALITY, a consuming 


interest in Fashion. Today, when so many things are debased “to 
meet a price,” we maintain our devotion to the quality ideal; we 


offer authentic style, honest measurements, reliable materials and 


workmanship — at fair prices season after season. We lean to 
understatement, rather than exaggeration, in both advertising and 
selling. We have good clothes for as much, or as little, as you 


want to spend. 


“YOUR MONEY’S WORTH AT BEST’S” has always been our 
policy. When you buy in our Fifth Avenue store or Suburban

CONNECTICUT: 
Connecticut still 


Despite all 
its commuters, 
has an agriculture and an indus- 
try of its own. The Connecticut 
farmers who really farm, in fact, 
far outnumber the Connecticut 
farmers who merely live there 
nights and week-ends. So Con- 
necticut has a generous exhibit 
devoted to its farms and factories 
as well as one which shows how 
well equipped the State is for 
comfortable living. And there is 
a diorama of Colonial Connecticut 
and an exhibit of tourist attrac- 
tions. Special item: The three- 
dimensional model section of the 
new Merritt Parkway, with a 
photo-mural background. (G-4)

ENTERED YALE 
Browning King Outfitted Him!” 


Last Fall, a young man from up-state came 
in and selected a wardrobe. He told us he 
was matriculating at New Haven, and then 
he added, “You know, Browning King is a 
sort of tradition in our family. My grand

Is 


father bought his clothes from you in 187 
when he was entering Yale... and all of us 


have been coming here since. 


Nothing we might say could better testify 
to the virtues of Browning King quality, 


value, and authentic fashion. 


This summer we expect to welcome many 
thousands of men and women from every 
corner of the nation , men and women 
who will look for the name of Browning 


King as one seeks out an old family friend.

item: The native Portuguese danc- 
ers singing folksongs. (A-3) 

RUMANIA: Rumania has what 
might be called a town house 
devoted to the art of living-—the 
Rumanian Pavilion-—-and an offi- 
cial exhibit in the Hall of Nations 
devoted to Rumanian industry 
and agricuiture. The pavilion is 
a four-story house designed in 
traditional Rumanian style aud 
decorated with the work of native 
artists and artisans. In it are dis- 
plays of Rumanian textiles, ce- 
ramics, rugs, furniture, painting 
and sculpture, used primarily as 
a setting for a Rumanian restau- 
rant serving native food prepared 
by chefs direct from Bucharest. 
Special item Caviar and fish 
fresh from the Black Sea. (F-4) 


SIAM: Siam has factories as 
well as twins and dancers. The

item Photographs of the Zim- 
babwe ruins, where legend says 
gold was smelted for Solomon 
and the Queen of Sheba. (E-2) 
SWEDEN: Remembering the 
smorgasbord, it is easy to under 
stand why the Swedish Pavilion 
is in the Food Zone rather than 
in the Government Zone. But the 
restaurant, managed by the 
Swedish American Line, is only 
a part of an exhibit that portrays 
Swedish tife and social progress 
in many ways. There are exhibi 
tion galleries, furnished rooms 
showing Swedish decorative arts 
and cabinet work, a motion-pic- 
ture theatre, and an information

the scene in the native restau- 
rant. Special item: The bowling 
alley, in the garden. (C-2) 


TURKEY: The official Turkish 
Government exhibit is in the Hall 
of Nations. Its focal point is a 
glass statue of Kemal Ataturk, 
first President of the Turkish Re- 
public. Displays are devoted to 
Turkish life, history and indus- 
try, with the emphasis on mod- 
ern Turkey. There is also the 
Turkish Pavilion in the Food 
Zone, a bazaar and restaurant 
group. Here are booths and shops 
where native artisans are mak- 
ing copper and brass bowls and 
jugs, doing leather work and 
weaving rugs. Native perfumes, 
tobaccos and fruits are on sales 
display. The restaurant serves 
French and American dishes as 
well as Turkish specialties. In 
the rear is a Turkish coffee bar. 
There is also a library of histor- 
ically important Turkish books.

topped only the Trylon of all the 
structures. The exhibit

and jewels, of the Palace of the 
Soviets, and there is a map of the 
whole Soviet Union made in a 
mosaic of precious stones. There 
are two motion-picture theatres 
showing. Soviet films on almost 
every subject, and there is a 
restaurant serving foods and 
wine native to various Russian 
districts. Those interested in ex- 


ploration will find a display of 


the equipment of the Papanin 
Iexpedition which drifted for 
eight months on the polar ice, and 


the air-minded visitor will see the 
plane which made the first non- 
Stop transpolar flight from Rus- 
sia to the United States. The 
exhibits deal with folk art, 
agriculture, crafts, re- 
sciences, (A separate

YUGOSLAVIA: America’s steel 
mills have long known the brawn

from Venezuela 


of the Yugoslavs, and American 
skyscrapers have risen on steel- 
work assembled by Yugoslavian 
skill; but not until after the 
World War did those Southeast 
Furopean migrants have a home- 
ind called Yugoslavia. Here, in 
the Hall of Nations, south, that 
homeland shows what it has 
accomplished in its brief inde- 
pendence. Here are graphic dis- 
plays of native life and modern 
industry. Special tribute is paid 
to Yugoslavias who have played 
@ part in American progress, par- 
ticularly the scientists, Nikola 
Tesla and Michael Pupin. Special 
item: The photographs of Yugo- 
slavian life taken by Miss Peggy

«Another Name For “Yew York’ 


@ You won't find it in the encyclopedia. You will find it in any 
lexicon of fashion...and in the minds and on the tongues of the 
Fashion Wise Men Of New York. 

For the words “John David’ mean the real New York. Not 
the flashy, often caricatured, city slicker New York. Buf the ur- 
bane New York of the truly sophisticated ...the true New York 
of the native “insiders”, to whom the wheres and the whys and 
the wear-fors are second nature. 

For the very reason that John David is headquarters formany 
New York residents .+.. John David will,.be a fashion meeting- 
place of all the really knowing visitors to New York during the 


great 1939 New York World’s Fair days 


Naturally you are coming to see the World of Tomorrow .. 
and naturally, you will be equally interested in New York’s own 
world of today. That world, when it comes to men’s fashions, 
is unlike any other anywhere. Its distinction derives from a 
subtle blend of high fashion and conservatism... both present 


. at one and the same time. 


TIMELY CLOTHES 


Timely Tailored 


No one knows these New York niceties better than John David. 


And nowhere will your greeting be warmer... when you are here,

THE TREME CENTER 


Whether the visitor has a 
single day or a full month in 
which to see the Fair, he will 


likely want to begin by having 
a look at the Perisphere and the 
the 
sphere for a six-minute study of 


Trylon and entering Peri

Other lofty vantage points, if 
one must climb, are the Ford

and the 250-foot tower of the

the Main Exhibit Area, and, far 
te the south, minarets, domes, Al- 
pine summits and other weird 
constructions of the Amusement 
Area 

For a comprehensive close-up 
of the heart of the Fair, the 
looker can do the Mall from the 
Perisphere to the Lagoon of Na 
tions and continue through the 
Court of Peace to the stately Fed- 
eral Building at the end of the 
long avenue

Transportation agencies in New

“the greatest peacetime migration 
in history.” Here are the ways to 
get there 
BY SUBWAY 

The Interborough Rapid Tran-

Transit subways will maintain a 
continuous express service from 
the center of the city to the new 
World's Fair station at Willets 
Point, where an overpass will lead 
directly the Fair Grounds. 
The station has a capacity of 40,- 


000 passengers an hour. The ex-

buildings are set in a 
of tree-lined avenues, shrubbery, 
pools, fountains

TO LIVE AMONG THINGS YOU LOVE 


WHERE AMONG all the World’s Fair panorama 


of the wonders of tomorrow, is there a sight to 


compare with the immediate charm of a living 


room planned and built just for you? Curtis in- 


vites you to have such a room. Our decorators 


will help you combine the best features of the past 


with brilliant touches borrowed from tomorrow, 


to make a place you love to live in right now—to- 


day. Since every chair and sofa is made in Curtis’ 


own workrooms, and bears our written construe- 


tion guarantee, each is in itself a possession to be 


proud of. Buying from the maker keeps the cost 


comfortably low, and besides, you know every 


style you choose is not only exclusive with Curtis, 


but also exclusive with you. Come in and talk it 


over. We're open Thursday evenings until 9 PM,

FIRST AID TO SIGHTSEERS 


Seventy-second Street in the park 
is the site of concerts and outdoor 
dancing during the Summer, and 
the Park Department can be 
counted on for special stunts like 
frog-jumping and _ barber-shop 
quartet competitions 

Fort Tryon Park, om the rocky 
the north end of Fort 
Washington 


heights at 
Avenue, overlooking 
Inwood, is the city’s newest big 


park and probably its most beauti- 


ful. Fort Washington Park, west 
of Riverside Drive between 165th 
and Dyckman Streets, cannot 
match Fort Tryon’s landscaped 
gardens but grows violets and 
Dutchman’s-breeches on its own. 

Riverside Park, most of which 
has been completely done over 


by Robert Moses, runs along the 


Drive from Seventy-second to 
125th Street. Its improvements 
are still being discovered by New 
Yorkers who cannot quite keep 
up with Mr. Moses 

The city’s largest park is Pel- 
ham Bay, the Bronx, terminal of 
a local branch of the L R. T. East 
Side line Van Cortlandt Park, 
on the other side of the Bronx, 
is a pet haunt of golfers, cross- 


country runners and hikers, and 


is one of the few places in town 


where you can see cricket played. 
Bronx Park, roughly between Pek 
ham and Van Cortlandt, houses 
the New York Botanical Garden 
as well as the zoo. 

Prospect Park is the largest in 
srooklyn; it has a spacious array 
of playing fielda, besides: botanical 





gardens, the zoo and a lake of its 
own. 

Much smaller, 
of its own, is Battery Park at the

SUITS TAILORED BY

Stein Lilo, 
“45 AND UP 


We've played an active part in New York life since the days 
when bankers rode downtown in high-backed Stanley 


Steamers. and ordinary mortals patronized the horse car. 


In an aflectionate. small-town sort of way. our customers have 
been our friends and confidantes. We have catered to their 
whims as a matter of course, designing and plotting their 
clothes. haberdashery, hats and shoes in a manner which suits 


their way of life. 


We call it “the New York manner. It us something you will note 
a hundred times in the course of a stroll up Park or Fifth any 


sunny afternoon. 


It means a certain neat. well-bred blending of color, pattern 
and texture...a casual, informal way of wearing one's clothes 


.a comfortable air that goes hand-in-hand with success and 


well-being. 


Whether you live in New York or are here for the Fair. we 
invite you to visit us at any of our thirteen shops. Just to pass 
the time of day. if vou like. Or to see how little it really costs 


to blend with the stimulating background of a great city.

builds PONTIAC 


There are hundreds of thousands of 

people who want a low-priced car 

—but who want more wheelbase, 
more comfort, beauty, safety and performance 
than the very lowest-price field affords. 
It is for these people that General Motors 
builds Pontiac. It represents a definite step 
up from the lowest-price field in quality and 
desirability—yet it is so scientifically de- 
signed and built that it sells for only a few 
dollars more than the lowest-priced car you 
can buy. 
Those who choose Pontiac are mighty proud 
of their choice. They say it offers the world’s 
finest combination of quality and price.

PRIMROSE PATH—Portrait of an engaging and disorderly family, a few cities 


with some of the funniest acting of the season by Helen 
Westley. Hearty and coarse. Opened Jan. 4, 1939. 

SET TO MUSIC—Noel Coward has written a perfect revue for 
Beatrice Lillie, the satire being keen and impish. Don't neglect 
tichard Haydn's imitation of a fish. Opened Jan. 18. 


SING FOR YOUR SUPPER—The Federal Theatre's 
imitation of Broadway shows. One remarkable sketch 
‘Papa Gets a Job.’’ Opened April 24. 

STARS IN YOUR EYES—Ethel Merman and Jimmy 
make a matchless team of buffoons in a musical 
lets them do their gustiest stuff. Opened Feb. 9

country George 8S. Kaufman and Moss Hart have staged a 
huge spectacle drama that serves as a primer in Americanism 
and democracy Fredric March in the chief part Opened 
Jan. 21 

THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE—Some of the best songs of the 
year in a sinful musical comedy suggested ever so faintly by 
Shakespeare's ‘‘A Comedy of Errors.’’ Jimmy Savo ranks 


high as a comic pantomimist. Opened Nov. 23, 1938. 
THE GENTLE PEOPLE—This is a socially minded fable about 


two amateur fishermen who live in Brooklyn and are preyed 
on by a gangster. Sylvia Sidney, Franchot Tone and Sam 
Jaffe head a Group Theatre cast Opened Jan. 5. Last three 
weeks. 

THE LITTLE FOXES—Lillian Hellman’s mordant and compactly 
written drama of rapacity in a Southern family, with Tallulah 
Bankhead giving the performance of her career in a brilliantly 
directed cast. Opened Feb. 15.

comedy about some society folks of Philadelphia gives 
Katharine Hepburn the best part she has had on the legitimate 
stage and conspires with her in a gay performance. Opened

THE SWING MIKADO—This is the original Negro variation 
on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, hailing from the Federal 
Theatre in Chicago and recently purchased by private industry. 
To begin its new career tomorrow. 

THE WHITE STEED—Paul Vincent Carroll's provincial comedy 
of a clerical battle in a small Irish village was unanimously

f the conti- 


000. The 


‘local 
fice 


record shows, too, that 
saturation,”’ as the box-of- 
it, was reached be- 
tween Jan. 12 and the Fair opening 
desks on Feb. 18; that 
worrying about ‘rifting in to visit the Fair, were 
for the big increase in 
business after that. Furthermore, 
the Alcazar is receiving reserva- 
tions and requests for information 
every day from other States, not- 
ably Nevada, Oregon, 
and Utah. 

All of this would indicate that a 
world's fair, instead of luring peo- 
ple away from the theatre, actually 
helps bring them into it. Probably 
it is correct to say that the average 
Fair visitor, if he is alloting him- 
self, say, three or four days of 
sight-seeing, will put aside at least 
one evening to see a good show. 

And that, of course, is the hitch: 
the show must be good. After an 
exhausting day of poking around 
the exposition grounds, no one 
wants to sit through a play of in- 
different quality. ‘‘Run Little Chil- 
lun’”’ has plenty of artistic flaws, 
but it is acted and sung with great 
vividness by its Negro cast; its the- 
atrical savagery has an almost bru-

OICE OF EXPERIEN CE 


But possibly the Fair had noth- 
ing to do with it For, although 
Ethel Barrymore's performance as 
Gran Whiteoak was generally ad- 
mired, San Franciscans did not 
care for the play; most of those 
who went found it a flabby enter- 
|tainment and, doubtless, urged 
| their friends to stay away. And “A 
| Broom for the Bride,” the Jacques 
| Deval comedy which came to the 
Curran March 23, received such 
lukewarm notices that the public 
stayed away altogether. It folded 
quietly after a poor week and a 


half. 
Se nh ®@ 
The cold truth of the matter is 


that the theatre has to marshal its 

best talents to compete with a fair. 

Every exposition offers certain pos- 

itive allurements for the entertain- 
; ment-seeker. At Flushing Meadows 

there will be a great many; at 

Treasure Island there are quite a 

few—the ‘‘Folies Bergére,’’ an ex- 

cellent girl-show, presented three 

|times a day (which over 300,000 
have already seen); a ‘‘Cavaicade 
of the Golden West,’’ the varied de- 
lights of the Gayway and, of course, 
the whole splendid pageant of the 
Fair itself. 

Against competition like this, the 
| so-so play wages a hopeless battle, 
and the better-than-average play 
stands about a 50-50 chance. Only 
the exceptionally good play can be 
sure of holding its own. Perhaps 
|it is significant that the mail-order 
|and seat sales for ‘‘Our Town” and 

“Of Mice and Men,”’ both of which 

come to San Francisco the week of 

May 23, have been uncommonly 

brisk Even this dist hinter-

The strength of Mr

Intelligent persons today are interested in a greater 


variety of subjects than ever before and desire informa- 
tion about all of them. They have their own particular 
fields, but in addition they want a thoroughgoing back- 


ground on all phases of human activity. 


They know that people who enjoy life most are those 
whose interests are most diverse. That’s why these alert 


and intelligent people read The New York Times regularly; 


They value its authoritative coverage of every depart- 


ment of human knowledge and activity: politics, govern- 


ment, economics, world affairs, labor, State and munic-

A “feature” differs only in length, | 


using the same facts, padded out to 
500 or 1,000 words. And al] ‘‘fillers’’ 
and “‘features’’ have their origin in 
what is called a ‘Screen Biogra- 
phy,’’ a mimeographed leaflet of 
six pages or more, consisting of 
.about a hundred questions, which 
each actor is required to fill out 
/upon joining a studio. Each studio 
devises its own “Biography” form, 
but the questionnaires are pretty 
much alike. 

This ‘“‘Biography’’ is the inspira- 
tion of practically every publicity 
story that comes from the studios 
and special press agents. Within 
the past year or two, stars—mostly 
because of the strength of the 
Screen Actors Guild—have been re- 
fusing interviews with free-lance 
writers and have refused to discuss 
personal, up-to-date happenings 
with studio representatives. But are 
the press agents foiled? Not at all! 
They simply refer to the ‘‘Biogra- 
phies,’’ find in them a rich treasure 
of pertinent facts that are perma- 
nent fodder for endless publicity 
barrages

Then the recurrent wheeze about 
the famed shipment of an elephant

‘What animals do you like?’ or 
“Do you have any pets?’’ And the 
one about the Lucrezia Borgia sti-

possessions or treasured items?’

There was a time, it is true, when 
usher was quite aus- 
tere—when he marched around the 
place with a ramrod down his back 
and marshaled the patrons into line 
with a frigid flick of his eyes. The 
usher’s uniform made a West Point 
er’s ‘‘dress”’ look like mufti, and his 
manner closely resembled that of a 
major general reviewing his troops 
More-timid folk entering the theatre 
were actually afraid of him and 
tried to sneak to their seats without 


his noticing. (Of course, he always 
did—and then, boy, what a silent 


dressing-down you got!)

Second Thoughts onthe WPA’s Product ‘ont |

By JOHN MARTIN 


TS first week of performances |

minor miracle for ‘‘Adelante,”’ 

the Federal Theatre's 
|}dance production of the 
| which opened rather discouragingly 
days ago at the dingy little 
Daly’s Theatre. Those who drop in 
to see it now will find that, unless 
they are distinctly blasé, it is likely 
to touch them more than once and 
to provide them with several grip- 
ping moments. 

Perhaps the most conspicuous 
change, though in actual dimen- 
sions it is a small one, has taken 
place in the staging. Poor lighting 
on the opening night served to take 
virtually every atom of theatre 
magic out of the performance and 
to emphasize the Federal Theatre’s 
understandable, but unfortunate, 
penchant for lean and meager 
mounting. That has been rectified 
now and, though the production is 
no more lavish, it has acquired an 
atmosphere which qualifies it as of 
the theatre. A few hours of effort 
with the switchboard have given 
| color and depth to the stage.

gales from within and from 
out, and it is gratifying to see that | 
her gallantry has not been in vain. | 

“Adelante’’ has been through the 
wars; in this embattled period 
the Federal Theatre, it has suffered 
cuts in personnel which necessitated 
adaptation and, 
the normal 


of 


patient in what 
might be called

had to make replacements 
time to time of dancers who found 
employment in other channels. But 
these are comparatively externa!

when Spain presented quite a 
different face, it has also had

change in its makeup. Neverthe

sible to interfere with it, it

From the first, its conception was | 
seen to be valid and dramatic. Of 
the several works in extended form 
Miss Tamiris has com- 
posed, none has achieved

no specific plot, but

to be watching what American en-

television once it gets “the bit in

but it is likely to be a slow, costly 
process, for television is a complex 
scientific giant that will take some 
time to get going full steam, espe- 
cially with the instruments priced 
from $200 to $1,000. In mass pro-

NQUIRY among stores planning | sion sets will be sold 1n 1939 is an 


to handle televison receivers re 
veals that there has been no 
rush on the part of New Yorkers 
during the past week to have video 
sets installed in time to look in on 


the opening ceremonies of the 
World's Fair today 

While the retailers have noted an 
increasing curiosity in television re- 
ceivers among store patrons, they 
believe that there has been no rush 
of orders for several reasons: regu- 
lar telecasting schedule to the home 


will not begin until Wednesday, 
sets will not go on sale officially 
until this week, advertising cam- 
paigns have not gone far, prices 


|are high and the public is adopting 


a ‘“‘watchful waiting’ policy to see 
what television has to offer. 


Estimating the Sales 


Another factor of sales resistance, 
according to retailers, is wonder- 
ment on the part of the public

television Christmas’’ if general 
business holds to keel. The less 


optimistic point to the fact that in 
London it has required three years 
of telecasting to get 14,000 sets ‘‘on 
the air.’’ 


The majority of the leading man 
ufacturers have yet to introduce 
their tele-models, and in trade cil 
cles it is believed that the televi 
sion campaign will not get under 
way with full steam until after 
Labor Day. Throughout the Sum- 
mer the public inferest will be 
studied. Furthermore, by that time 
the Columbia Broadcasting Sys- 


tem’s station atop the Chrysler

“Often parents are too busy to

at home, as the majority do and 
for whom the opera was written 
and staged, the comment is that 
the production was too chattery 
and lacked sustained melody, the 
vital element that Coes so much 
make a musical work flow smooth- 
| ly and interestingly from loud- 
| Speakers. 
| That the NBC Symphony Orches-

| and listeners agreed. Satisfied that 
| Mr. Menotti is on the right track 
in helping to create a new art 
form, a high official of the NBC 


| was heard to remark that he could 


go to work right away on another 
production. 

Another official thought that ‘“The 
Old Maid and the Thief”’’ might 
some day be revived as a television 
performance because its thirteen 
scenes and simple settings are be 


| lieved to qualify it for the cameras. 


From a technical and electrical 
standpoint the music-play was a 
| radio masterpiece that adhere@ te 
| the simplicity of thought and s : 
manship which broadcast listening 
|demands for clear understanding 
j}and creating of ‘‘mind-pictures,”’ 
but had it been endowed with more 
airs it would have been more enter 
taining to the unseen audience 

It often happens that in the stu- 
dio the eye is so completely enter- 
tained that what is offered the ear 
is overlooked by those attending 
the performance. Nevertheless t 
beyond the rabbit-eared micr 
phone, it is only sound that count 
the studio scene and action giarm<: 
and people that go to make 
gala night are, missing. It's the 
melody that lingers on. O. E. D

GUIDING OUR SHIPS FOR 150 YEARS 


Federal Lighthouse Service, Created in 1789, Honored for Work 


Of Aiding Navigation Along 40,000 Miles of Shoreline 


By L. C. 8PEERS 


ASHINGTON.—A__ great 

and seldom _ publicized 

service that has aided the 

safe navigation of every 
craft along America’s coasts and 
in so doing has prevented the loss 
of uncounted thousands of mari- 
ners and travelers and millions of 
dollars in property, is celebrating 
this year the 150th anniversary of 
its organization as a Federal 
agency. It is the United States 
Lighthouse Service, of which Alex- 
ander Hamilton was the first super- 
intendent. The law creating the 
service was the ninth act of the 
First Congress and was signed by 
President Washington on Aug. 7, 
1789. 


On the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf | 


Coasts of the American mainland, 


on the shores of Alaska, Hawaii, | 


Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Panama 
Canal, on the Great Lakes, along 
the Mississippi, and the other 
navigable rivers of the United 
States, more than 29,000 alds to 
safe navigation are flashing warn- 
ing signals today, and the number 
continues to increase. 


A Fraternity of Safety 


In the operation of this service 
politics has never played a part. 
Its men look upon their work as 
& career profession, and upon 
themselves as a fraternity whose 
business is to safeguard ships at 
sea. Today the operation of this 
vast service, whose field of action 
covers more than 40,000 miles of 
shoreline, costs to operate only 
about $10,000,000 a year 

“The United States Lighthouse 
Service,’’ in the words of Harold D. 
King, its chief, “‘is the cheapest in- 
surance in the world, an insurance 
absolutely indispensable so far as 
the safety of the men and women 
who travel by sea are concerned.” 

The record of the Lighthouse 

Service from its humble beginning 
in colonial times to ‘its present 
status, with great electrically oper- 
ated beacons, radio equipment, 
sturdy lightships and numerous 
|other aids to safe navigation un- | 
| known in Washington’s time, forms 
one of the most stirring stories in 
the government files. 

When the service was organized 
150 years ago its nucleus was twelve 
lighthouses built by the Colonies, 
six in Massachusetts and one each | 
in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, 
Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware | 
and South Carolina. Sandy Hook 
and the Virginia Capes, today key 
positions for lighthouses, lacked 
them then and the lighthouses that | 
did exist—at Boston, Charleston, 
S. C., and a few other places—were 
feeble affairs compared with the 
splendid navigational aids now safe- 
guarding the danger spots on every 
coast over which the American flag 
flies. 

Boston Light was the first light- 
house built in the United States. 
Storm, fire and other disasters have 
overtaken it many times during its 

| 223 yeagg, but it still stands to guide | 


mariners. The first keeper of Bos- 
ton Light, and therefore also the 
first American lighthouse keeper, 
was George Worthylake, who, with 
his wife and daughter, was 
drowned Nov. 3, 1718, the first mar- 
tyrs of the service. This tragedy 
inspired “‘The Lighthouse Ballad,"’ 
‘written by Benjamin Franklin, who 
was 13 years old at the time. 

The names of other early light- 
house keepers were such as figured 
largely in early American history. 
Joseph Seward was one, 
was Abner Lowell and others in- 
cluded a Whipple, a Lincoln, a 
Knox, an Ely and a Huntingdon 
They were the pioneers who 
trimmed the wicks and kept the 
lamps burning in the lighthouses of 
more than two hundred years ago. 

The first lighthouse to be erectea 
by and at the expense of the United 
States Government was Cape Henry 
Light in Virginia, marking the en- 
trance to Chesapeake Bay and thus 
the water gate to Norfolk, Balti- 
more and Washington. The con- 
tract for its construction was signed 
|in 1791 by Hamilton and the builder, 
| John McComb Jr. of New York, 
|the latter describing himself as a 
| bricklayer by trade. By 1801 there 
| were twenty lighthouses, among 
them such famous beacons as those 
at Sandy Hook, 
N. Y., Tybee Island, Ga., Cape Cod 
and Cape Hatteras. By 1925 the 
lighthouses on the Atlantic and 

vulf shores totaled seventy-six. To- 
day the lighthouses along America’s 
coastlines, continental and insular, 

number 521.

Islands, where the 
stands on a rocky

The candlepower of the principal 
American lighthouses evidences the 
vital role of the service in safe- 
guarding navigation. The great 
lights are visible for miles out at 
sea. Even the shaft of the rather 
small light on Fire Island can be 
seen for about nineteen miles; yet 
its candlepower is only 280,000, com- 
pared with the 900,000 of the great 
beam that flashes out to sea from 
Navesink (N. J.) Light, the most 
powerful in the whole American 
system. 

The more than 150 lights that are 
greatest in candlepower, none of 
them less than 100,000, guard the 
danger zones of every seacoast 
State in the Union, of every State 
bordering on the Great Lakes and 
even such tiny insular possessions 
as Howland, Wake and Midway in 
the Pacific. The candlepower of 
these principal lighthouses is in ex- 
cess of 76,000,000. 

In addition to the lighthouses, the 
more than 29,000 navigational safety 
aids operated by the Lighthouse

greatly from the common concep- 
tion of the early lighthouse. Light-

to get there. 

It makes difference whether 
the prospective World’s Fair visitor 
starts from Times Square or Tim- 
buktu; officials of the railroad, 
steamship, bus and air say 
they are prepared to transport all 
travelers to the Fair safely, quickly 
and, compared to the regular trans- 
port rates, inexpensively. 

It is a simple matter for the New 
Yorker to reach the Fair. He can 
take a train from Times Square, 
Rockefeller Center, Grand 
and other subway stations. He can 
shuttle out on the Long Island Rail-

If the prospective visitor wants to 
make all his plans for visiting the 
Fair before he leaves home he can 
easily do so through railroad or bus 
agents or the nearest travel bureau. 

The procedure is simple. The visi- 
tor decides how long he wants to 
stay in New York, how much he 
wants tospend and how he wants to 
travel. Special all-expense ‘pocket 
lasting from 


tours, 


tours” are provided 
two days to two weeks or more. No 
matter what tour the visitor chooses 
he can arrange for the following 
sort of itinerary in New York: 

A uniformed representative of a 
travel agency meets hin at his ter- 
minal on arrival. From’ there he 
and his baggage are taken by taxi 
to a hotel where room reservations 
and plans for meals have already 
been made. Tips, transportation to 
Flushing and a souvenir admission 
to the Fair are included in the price 
of this tour. Costs of tours range 
from about $10 for a two-day visit 
to about $40 for a week’s stay. A

the Fair restaurants or at the hotel. 
A motor tour of New York is in- 
cluded in some of the special aill- 
expense trips. Upon departure a 
guide helps with all details of bag- 
gage, travel reservations and trans- 
portation to the station. The same 
sort of tour is offered to large 
groups. One travel agency has a 
special tour for groups of high 
school students. The students come 
by special car and live at Fordham 
University while in°-New York. 


Circular Tour of Nation 


The visitor, however, doesn’t have 
to go on a tour to be entitled to the 
reduced rates on the: railroads or 
buses, or special services on steam- 
ship or air lines. The $90 round-trip 
railroad coach rate for seeing both 
the New York and San Francisce 
fairs and making a general circular 
tour of the country is now in effect 
and will continue until Oct. 28. The 
same trip traveling first class is 
$135. The special Pullman fare is 
$45. The traveler can start the cir-

Other special rates are made for

INGSTON.—Next Saturday 
and Sunday Ulster County's 
second annual apple blos- 
som festival will be held in 
this city and in neighboring town- 
ships and villages. 

The festival this year is being pre- 
sented by the newly formed Ulster 
County Council, which, heartened 
by the great success of last year’s 
blossom celebration, is anticipating 
an influx of more than 10,000 visi- 
tors 

The Ulster County Farm Bureau 
reports that the hundreds of square 
miles of otchards in Southern UI- 
ster from Mariborough to a few 
miles north of Kingston will be at 
the height of their beauty for the 
festival.

Grange and school girls will present 
apples to passing motorists. 

In contrast to last year’s celebra- 
tion, which was decentralized, the 


major events this year will be held 
in Kingston, the county seat, and 
will begin with the coronation of 
the queen on Saturday morning 
Forsyth Park. An _ elaborate 


pageant will precede the coronation 
ceremonies and more than 400 


school children and prominent citi- 
zens of the county will participate. 
Music will be furnished by the 
Kingston High School Band. 

In the afternoon, county commun- 
ities, fraternal organizations, so- 
cieties, schools and business organi- 
zations will participate in a three- 
mile-long parade to be made up 
mainly of motorized floats. 

At the close of the coronation 
parade tours will be made to the 
apple blossom regions and to the 
Ashokan Reservoir area. In many 
communities—notably New Paltz 
with its famous street of the 
Huguenots where stand five houses 
erected in the early seventeenth 
century, Stone Ridge, Rosendale, 
Hurley and Saugerties—visitors will 
be shown the stone houses of colo- 
nial days, Outstanding among his- 


toric buildings will be the Senate 
House, Kingston, which was New 
York State's first capitol. 

Saturday evening at the Kingston 
Municipal Auditorium the corona- 
tion ball will be held, at which time 


the queen and her court will lead 


a grand march.

Youth “ae a Operate Plas Rhiw aedog in 
Backwoods of North W ales 


By EDWARD JASON 


NE of the most interesting 

of the Youth Hostels of Eu- 

rope is the old castle, Plas 

Rhiwaedog, in the heart of 
the picturesque backwoods 
Wales. The castle is a highlight of 
the large chain of hostels catering 
to vagabondia. 

North Wales is noted as one of 
the most scenic sections of Great 
Britain. It is in this territory that 
the hostler, toting a rucksack on 
his shoulder, climbs a picturesque 


oxpath winding up through a small | 


forest to reach the castle. Below, 
on the left, a beautiful, 
is seen through the trees. 
the path leads to an opening and 
the magnificent spectacle of the old 
buildings. 

The massive rock walls date from 
876, when the castle was built by 
the Welsh Prince Liewarch-Hen, 
who was the descendant of a Welsh 


King on his father’s side and an/| 


Irish King on his mother’s. A few 
centuries later it was the home of 
Owen-the-Great, who died in 1170. 
Parts of the castle were added in 
1311. In 1666 it was a Royalist 
stronghold for Charles I against 
Cromwell. In recent years it has 
been the property of the Price 
family, prominent in Welsh society. 
When their estate filed bankruptcy 
proceedings the properties 
sold at auction.

artistic touches are manifest in the 
gay pink-flowered wall paper of the 
dining room. He is rather ashamed 
of the kitchen, though it is one of 
the few rooms of the castle that has 
|retained its old charm. A large, 
open fireplace with a dirt hearth is 
built into the massive gray-stoned 
walls, which appear unchanged by 
the centuries. Here dishwashing 
| becomes a gay task. 

The common room is very large 
and strewn with rough hewn furni- 
ture. There are several bay win- 
| dows. One can see that the walls 
are many feet thick. About the 
walls are many sketches of various 
parts of the castle, some by noted 
|artists and others by visiting host- 
lers. 
curfew the procession to the twenty- 
j}eight bedrooms is made with the 
| help of kerosene lamps. The hostlers 
| unpack their sleeping bags and 
;}spread them on cots provided by 
the hostels. 


Filled to Capacity 


On holiday# and week-ends, espe- 
cially in the Summer season, the 
castle is usually filled to capacity, 
often with rmore than a hundred 
hostlers. These are gay times, and 
the warden makes the most of 
them. Waiters are called. in from 
Bala to serve dinner and local talent 
is rounded up for an entertainment. 
| If the hostler wishes to rest, it is 
pleasant to loll about the spacious 
;}grounds and take leisurely walks 
down to the lake. Or he may fill 
| every moment at Plas Rhiwaedog 
} with an ambitious program. As far 
|} off the beaten path and as provin- 
| cial as is this setting, the castle is 
| not lost to the world. On this 
| writer's first night here, he was 
'amused to hear the warden’s wife 
burst into raptures of broken Eng- 
lish about a Kay Francis film she 
| had just seen in the near-by town 
| of Bala. 

A five-minute walk down the 
| wooded hill of the castle and the 
hostler reaches the quaint town of 
Rhos-y-Gwalia, which boasts five 
| gray stone cottages and a post-

Ionian Islands Stamps 

Word comes from Dr. S&. 
Macrymichalos, chairman of the 
Hellenic Philotelic Society, that 
Greece's promised stamps to com- 
memorate the annexation of the 
Ionian Islands seventy-five years 
ago will be confined to three 
values: 60-lepta, coat-of-arms of the 
islands; 12-drachmas, Castle of 
Corfu, and 40d, portraits of Queen 
Victoria of Great Britain and King 
George I of Greece. Engraved in 
London and printed in Athens, the 
series is expected to be released 
on May 21. 


This will be the first reproduction 
ofa British 
on postal paper not associated with 
Britain or possessions, and Queen 
Victoria is to be thus honored be- 
cause she was on the throne when 
Britain presented the Ionian Islands 
to Greece on the occasion of the 
coronation of George I, 

The Ionian Islands had one of the 
briefest and scantest records in 
philatelic history. As a protectorate 
under Britain, distinctive stamps 
with a Victorian head were issued |

It was during 


and 


this huddle that Mr. 
MacPherran made his unfortunate 
comment. Declarer thereupon 
played the heart ace, cashed the 
diamond king, and led a low dia- 
mond. Here Mr, MacPherran made 
a good play by discarding a spade 
instead of his lone club. Dummy 
ruffed low and ieturned the trump

and threw back on lead

the trick with the ace, 
dummy had only clubs to lead and

The result was a 500-point set, one 
trick of which could have been

Architect Says Ranks Have Been 
Greatly Depleted 


shortage of skilled architectural 
draftsmen in the event of a build- 
ing boom is seen by C. C. Zant- 
zinger, of Philadelphia, chairman 
of the committee on education of 
the American Institute of Archi- 
tects 

He points out that since 1936 en- 
rollment in architectural schools 
appears to have been at a stand- 
still; and that many draftsmen 
have been attracted from local com- 
munities to Washington in recent 
years to do work in various gov- 
ernmental agencies 

The consensus of opinion, he says, 
is that the current year will show | 
an increase in enrollment at archi- 
tectural schools but there is some 
question as to whether those drafts- 
men who went to Washington will 
stay there or be glad to return to 
their local communities should 
more building activity occur 

Commenting on the housing prob- 
lem, Mr. Zantzinger says that its 
solution is ‘‘very definitely’’ one of 
the major responsibilities of the 
architectural profession in that it 
must avoid too great a standardl- 
zation and keep some variety in 
struction. 

The problem will take care of it- 
self, however, he believes, if every 
school does its best to turn out 
graduates who can think on any 
subject and who have the proper 
traditions of their craft 

“Some schools,”’ he adds, ‘will 
feel that such a situation as hous- 
ing does impose special responst- 
bility, others will not Probably, 
the majority will ‘ee in it a worth- 
while subject for a minor course

_NEW _ YORK TIMES 


LUMBER DEALERS URGE 
LOW-COST BUILDING 


National Body Pledges Aid to 


Commerce Chamber 


The National Retail Lumber Deal- 
ers Association announced yester- 
day that it had thrown the full sup- 
port of its 23,000 members behind 
the program of the United States 
Chamber of Commerce to organize 
“Build Your Home Now” drives in 
communities throughout the coun- 
try. 

In 


sent 


which 
regional and 
throughout the 
the national organi- 
zation urged material men to co- 
operate with local chambers of 
commerce to promote home build- 
ing, especially in the low-cost types. 
As an example of how each com- 
munity can cooperate in the move- 
ment, the promotional plan inaugu- 
rated by New Orleans, which has 
set a goal of 1,500 new homes at 
average cost of $4,000 during 
1939, is cited as a model. The na- 
tional chamber is broadcasting de- 
tails of this campaign to 400 cham- 
bers of commerce in as many com- 
munities, with the suggestion that 
similar programs be launched. 
The New Orleans drive, the asso- 
ciation pointed out, is predicated on 
the theory that any aid to the build- 
ing business will increase the busi- 
ness and profits of every person 
engaged in business of any kind 
The campaign in New Orleans 
will start next Sunday and will con- 
tinue for thirteen weeks. It will 
cost an estimated $14,000, to be sub- 
scribed by allied building and fi- 
nancial interests of the city 
Don A. Campbell, president of the 
lumber association, pointed out that 
there is an estimated need of 750,- 
000 homes throughout the country 
each year for the next five years 
before a balance between supply 
and demand can be reached,

habilitation program for ob- 
solete properties may provide a sub- 
stantial measure of f to the 
railroad interests, states S. Earl 
Honig, president of William S. 
Sussman, Inc 

Mr. Honig's views, expressed in a 
letter to President Roosevelt, em- 
phasized the extent of railroad hold- 
ings whose potentialities for in- 
creased income, he declared, have 
been neglected or overlooked. 

In his letter Mr. Honig called 
attention to the fact that among 
the railroad realty holdings are 
240,000 miles of main track involved 
with yards, terminals, stations, aux- 
iliary buildings, sidings, miscella- 
neous types of properties as well as 
rolling stock.

ABOUT TUDOR CITY? 


In what respect is Tudor City different? 


Tudor City is not just a res 


idential neighborhood; it is s 


residential community, large enough to maintain and 
control its own distinctive character. Every building is 
under the same management and enjoys the same high 


standard of service 


Private parks create a beautiful 


setting for its twelve fine buildings and assure plenty of 


light, air, aad sunshine for 


the entire area. 


Where is Tudor City located? 


On a hill at the easterly en 


d of 42nd Street overlooking 


the East River, in the area bounded by 40th and 44th 
Streets and First and Second Avenues. It is apart from 
the crowds and confusion of the City itself, yet con- 
veniently close to transportation Jines and all the activi- 
ties of midtown New York. 


Are all services available 


regardless of rental ? 


Yes. Whether you live in a one-room apartment Of In a 
penthouse 32 stories above the East River, all of Tudor 
City’s special services are available to the extent you 


wish to use them.

Another counter, for serving or gar-

Concrete Floors Need Care 
Attention is called to the fact that 
concrete floors are susceptible to 
hard wear and must be cared for 
properly to provide good service, 
Sometimes they wear badly in spots, 
leaving an accumulation of white 
powdery dust This may be pre- 
vented by the application of a coat 
or two of concrete-hardening com- 
pound To correct such a spot the 
worn concrete should be removed 
and patched with fresh material 


Many concrete paints are available 
which will protect the surface of 
the concrete and prolong its wear.

Says the Cornelius Family 


ALT water lovers, we Mave spent many happy vacations along 
the Jersey shore. Well we knew the charm of its sun-drenched, 
snow-white beaches—the zest of its unsurpassed surf bathing—the 
colorful swirl of its famous resorts—the warm hospitality of its 
friendly peop! When we thought about buying a summer home 
there wasn'i the slightest doubt in our minds as to where it would 
be. The place we bought on the Jersey Shore ‘with the ocean as 
our front door’, is close enough to the City to make commuting 
convenient, which means that every member of the family can enjoy 
seashore life daily throughout the long summer 


New Jersey is a Good Place to LIVE. . to WORK.

the New Jersey Association of Real 
Estate Boards, competent realtors 
and buying counselors, whose assis- 
tance (whether you plan to buy or
