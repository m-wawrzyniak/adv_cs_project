Special to Tas New Yorx Times. 
WASHINGTON, April 30—Ef-

Atlantic seacoast on a volun- 
tary basis has failed and in the

‘LOWER RATES ON CREDITS | 


Revised Computing Method, 
Also to Be Voted On Today, | 
Provides Scale of 8 to 5% 


Special to Tas New Yorn Times 

WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
corporation excess profits tax, one 
of the principal methods upon 
which President Roosevelt is rely- 
ing to reduce war profits, was ten- 
tatively fixed at a flat 90 per cent 
today at a conference between 
Treasury officials and experts of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 

When the committee meets to- 
morrow it is expected to approve 
this drastic increase, which con- 


trasts with a present graduated | 
schedule ranging from 35 per cent | 


upon the first $20,000 to 60 per 
cent on everything above $500,000 


and with the rates of 50 to 75 per | 
cent proposed by Secretary Mor- | 


genthau. 

The suggestion for still higher 
taxes was advanced by Colin F. 
Stam, chief expert of the joint 
Congressional Committee on Inter- 
nal Revenue, as consistent with the 
point in the President's anti-infla- 
tion program calling for taxing of

Method for Computing Credit 

Randolph Paul, special tax ad- 
to Secretary Morgenthau, 
and committee experts have agreed 
upon a revision m the method of 


computing credits on invested cap- 


ital which will increase the taxible 


excess profits of large corpora- 
tions. 
This provided for credit of 8 per 


|}cent on the first $5,000,000 of in- 
| vested capital, 


7 per cent on the 
;néxt $5,000,000, 6 per cent on the 
/next $190,000,000 and 5 per cent 


on all over $200,000,000, 
This represents a considerable 


| reduction from the 8 per cent credit 
}on the first $5,000,000, with 7 per 


cent on all over that amount, al- 
lowed under the present law. 


As Secretary Morgenthau had

That method provides for an al-

members said tonight that there

CHUNGKING, China, April 30 
Five years of Japanese aggression 
jin China, with all its slaughter, 
looting and wholesale destruction 
of industrial enterprise and cul- 
| tural institutions, has resulted in 
mass migration of a large section 
of the population, affecting fifty 
million persons, comparable to the 
entire population of France or the 
British Isles. This may

it has been a tremendous force in

British Taxes on Estate 
Cut Heavily Into Legacies 


Wireless to Tus New Yorn Times 

LONDON, April 30-—-Taxation 
in Britain has reached such a 
high level that the £2,000,000 es 
tate of Philip was 
not enough to provide an annuity 
of £11,000 free of all tax, which 
he left after other bequests to a 
cousin, Mrs. Hannah Gubbay. 

At current tax rates a gross 
annual income of £312,750 would 
be necessary to provide such an 
annuity, and the capital amount 
required to provide such an in- 
come would be £10,425,000 It 
was held in the law courts today 
that Mrs. Gubbay was entitled to 
have annuity based on the avail-

Since no Chinese city with a

the authorities in Free China have 
taken advantage of the opportuni- 
ties to institute city planning. Dis- 
persal is the keynote of recon-

Paris that the Nazis have 
pressed into their service. 
Many direct hits with the biggest | 
|bombs were scored on both the! 
;Gnome-Rhone plant and the former 
| Goodrich factory. 
Fires started by the first arrivals 
| burned so brightly that the crews 
of planes arriving over the targets 
later could not see their own bombs 
burst. Some of the fires were still 
burning twelve hours later when 
R. A. F. reconnaissance planes flew 
over to photograph the scenes. 

Since the last R. A. F. raid in 
the Paris area the Nazis had 
| brought in many more anti-aircraft 
guns. The British pianes flew in

| 200 feet, the pilot said. 

Both the Gnome-Rhone plant and

This made a total of 150 Nazi

the same six nights, it was said, 
the R. A. F. dropped more than

on Axis moves. 

The Tokyo newspaper Hochi, ac- 
cording to a Tokyo broadcast, fore- 
cast a meeting within a few days 


|of Herr Hitler, Signor Mussolini 


and General Oshima, without indi- 
cating where they would get to- 
gether. The Berlin radio put out 


|a Munich dispatch reporting Gen- 
|eral Oshima’s arrival at that past 


meeting place of Herr Hitler and 
Signor Mussolini. But he was 
there ostensibly to participate in 


“the week of interstate cultural 
| work.” 


General Oshima recently re- 


| turned to Germany from Bulgaria, 


where he conferred with the Japa- 
nese Ambassador to Turkey, pre- 
sumably canvassing the Axis sit- 


| uation in the Middle East. 


The editorial mouthpiece of Ital- 
ian fascism, the Giornale d'Italia, 
without mentioning General Oshi- 


|ma, contributed a hint that the 
| meeting would be one of a series 


that would parallel “examinations,

Island's Situation, Airfields, Naval Base 
Contribute to Its Importance in War 


By HANSON W. BALDWIN 


The great isiand of Madagascar, 

base at

harbors in the world, has assumed 


with its naval Diego 


Suarez, one of finest natural 
in the past week a new significance 
in the complicated strategy of the 
Indian Ocean.

France, becomes a potential stake

which is 
of war. Recently there have been 
slight and inconclusive, but signifi- 
cant, reports that the strategic im- 
portance of this great island has 
not gone unnoted. Three cruisers

from Madagascar across

Madagascar is almost as large 
as the State of Texas. It is the 


third largest island in the world, | 


next in size to New Guinea and 
Borneo. Its length is about 1,000) 
miles; its extreme width, 360 miles. | 
The central plateau is about 3,000 
to 5,000 feet high, with broken hill 
masses in the lower plains, Gold 
and other mineral deposits and ex- 
cultivation of rice, coffee 

sugar cane, and 
tropical or  semi-tropical

But the island’s importance 
stems from its geographical situa- | 
ion, the several airfields and the 
great reaching bay of Diego} 
Suarez, potentially one of the 


| most important naval ports in the 


Ocean, 

Madagascar lies squarely on the 
main shipping routes around the 
Cape of Good Hope to India and 
the Middle East, and it is not far 
from the ‘irect routes from Cape 
Town to Australia With other 
little islands it provides potential 
stepping-stones for a plane-ferry 
route across the Southern Indian 
Orean Bases in Madagascar, if 
implemented by a sufficient force 
of planes and ships, would virtu- 
ally control the western part of 
the Indian Ocean, 

The island has three great ad-

‘vantages strategically, in addition | 


to its geographical situation. It can 

grow enough foodstuffs to be 

largely self-sufficient; it has a nat- 

ural naval base, with a large dry- 

dock, wharfage space and machine 

shops; and it has numerous _air- 

fields 

The naval base is at Antsirane 

on great, land-locked Diego Suarez 

Bay. This bay is virtually enclosed 

by thickly wooded heights that rise | 
sheerly to an elevation of 260 feet. |

The threat to Madagascar—if,

any great Japanese force across 
the Indian Ocean to seize the is- 
land. Far more important to fore- 
stall is any political, economic and |

forced or otherwise, of Vichy). If | 
such a development is threatened, |

FIRST LAKES SUBMARINE 


The Peto Is Launched on the 
Manitowoc River in Wisconsin 


Special to THe NEW York TIMES 


MANITOWOC, Wis., April 30— 


The first submarine ever built for | 


the Navy on the Great Lakes was 
launched here today in an impres- 


sive and simple ceremor y symbolic | 


of the speed and seriousness with 
which the country’s industrial man 
power is fighting on the war’s pro- 
duction front 

The Peto slid into the Manitowoc 
River at 11:50 A. M. amid the 
shrieking of whistles. Hundreds of 
shipyard workers, whom Captain 
E. A. Lofquist, Chief of Staff of the 
Ninth Naval District, characterized 
as “blue jackets of production,” 
saw the submarine splash into the 
water and thousands of onlookers 
witnessed the launching. 

Mrs. Lofquist broke a bottle of 
champagne over the bow of the 
submarine as the retaining ropes 
were cut and the vessel slid side- 
ways into the water, the first to be 
launched in this fashion in the 
United States.

The automobile insurance indun-| 


agreement to construe policies now |

was announced yesterday. 

Binding as of today and for the 
duration of the war, this agree- 
ment applies to any emergency use 
by or in behalf of any duly consti- 
tuted civil or military authority in 
furtherance of war or defense ac-| 
tivities, or any use by or in behalf 
of the American Red Cross, Office 
of Civilian Defense, or other simi- 
larly recognized organization in 
furtherance of such war or defense 
activities. 

If insurance is afforded by the 


| policy to any individual with re- 


spect to his operation of, or pres-| 
ence in, automobiles of others, such | 
insurance also will be construed to 
apply to an automobile used under | 
the conditions described. 

The agreement is not retroac- 
tive, and shall not affect accidents 
that occurred before today. 

Announcement of the broadening | 
of insurance protection for auto- 
mobile owners and users was made | 
jointly by the National Bureau of 
Casualty and Surety Underwriters, | 
the American Mutual Alliance and| 
the Mutual Casualty Insurance 
Rating Bureau, in behalf of eighty- 
nine members and subscribers that 
signed the agreement. 

The agreement was made “in 
recognition of the participation by 
the public in war and defense ac- 
tivities requiring use of automo- 
biles and in order to facilitate such | 
participation,” the announcement| 
said

Square 


No Signal Sounded 


The Paramount Theatre at Forty- 
third Street seemed to be the first 
to black-out in Times Square. As| 
if by signal—and there was no| 
audible warning of blackout, only | 
individual timepieces—other shops, 
theatres, restaurants and stores | 
pulled their drapes or extinguished 
their lighting. 

The traffic lights at Forty-fifth | 
Street in the Square, two on the 
west side and one on the east, re- 
mained lit after all else in Times 
Square was dark. They blinked | 
gravely on and off in alternate red 
and green—jeweled beacons in the | 
blackout—until an emergency crew 
dimmed them. 

The crowd, estimated at more 
than 50,000 in the Square alone, 
murmured about the mystic at, | 
mosphere, but seemed to revel in 
it. On the other hand, when some | 
stores and automobiles switched 
on their lights a minute or two be- 
fore actual close of blackout, the 
crowd in anger, forcing | 
hasty dimming by the offenders. 

Behind drawn blinds and cur- 
throughout the blackout, 
New York light life ran its normal 
course undimmed. High on the 
Astor Roof under blacked-out sky- 
lights and in the Rainbow Room in 
Rockefeller Center the night clubs 
played as usual. In Madison Square 
Garden the circus clowns and ele- 
phants paraded. Theatres were 
crowded.

lights were kept on. In many} 
places, as extra precaution, indi- 
vidual table lamps and wall lights 
were covered with extra shielding. 

Five hundred policemen manoeu- 
vred through the Square— mounted 
men, foot patrolmen and detec- 
tives. They prevented the unusual 
crowds from loitering, firmly but 
politely ordering them to find shel- 
ter for the blackout period. The 
crowds were kept out of the open 
reaches, as around Father Duffy's 
statue and the safety island back 
of The Times Building 

Air raid wardens efitered the 
Square before 9 o'clock. They took 
their posts with a look of grim 
purpose. Fire wardens stood by 
fire boxes with equal gravity and 
determination, restlessly studying 
Times Square in its unhappy dark 
war cloak. Beyond the margin of 
| the Square the dim-out was appar- 
ent. There was no lighted skyline 


General Effect Is Eerie 
Two nights of dim-out had more

effect was eerie and somewhat 


|melancholy even under full moon. 


By the Paramount's darkened 
two tall doormen stalked 
their little beats and their progress 
| was marked by luminous belts that 
| glowed faintly purple. 

A luminous painted sign at the 
| outside box office faintly glowed 
in greenish legend “Box Office In- 
side,” and patrons who passed the 
outer doors were momentarily 
startled at the sight of cashiers 
wearing phosphorescent buttons. 
Inside, however, the corridors were 
alight and curtains kept the rays 
from the street. 

City churches presented an awe- 
some aspect. Under the soaring | 
arches of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, 
lost in upper gloom, only one light | 
was visible. It was the sanctuary 
lamp. It flickered feebly in em-

seen through the stained glass

against other, non-belligerent, neutral, free and peace-loving peoples. It

For this we are fighting. For this it is necessary to strain our energy

Greek Labor adopts and encourages the single anti-axis action of the 
Balkan peoples, which can actively help the titanic fight carried on by

General Motors Corporation,

try, by the War 
Board for violation of 
the war agency's priority regula- 


tions 


The

was cited today 
Production 


As a punishment 
was prohibited from manufactur- 
ing any but functional replace- 
ment parts for automobiles for a 
period of three months, beginning 
Saturday 

According to WPB’s suspension 
order, the company’s Ternstedt 
Manufacturing Division used 10,- 
259 pounds of chrome steel in the 
manufacture of decorative mold- 
ings for automobiles between Jan. 
7 and March 9 of this year. 

The company also was found 
guilty of using 9,239 pounds of 
primary aluminum and 11,492 
pounds of secondary aluminum to 
produce radiator grills and other 
body hardware in violation of limt- 
tation orders invoked by the 
board. 

Complaints that the Ternstedt 
Division had used large quantities 
of copper, nickel and zinc in viola- 
tion of WPB orders were investi- | 
gated by the board and proved to 
be without foundation, the agency 
added 

The WPB investigation of the 
last-named complaints showed that 
Ternstedt’s use of the metals in 
question had not been in violation 
of the terms of any orders existing | 
at the time. 

Today's order prohibits General 
Motors Corporation “from manu- 
facturing producing any re- 
placement parts for passenger au- 
tomobiles, light, medium and heavy 
trucks, truck trailers, passenger 
carriers and school bus_ bodies 
other than functional replacement 
parts as defined in General Prefer- | 
ence Order P-57 and P-107.” 

The automobile company ts en- | 
gaged almost entirely in war work 
at the present time and ranks 
among the first ten producers in 
the country in the volume of such 
contracts. Along with other auto- 
mobile manufacturers it dismantled 
its automobile production lines 
some weeks ago in order to swing 
its productive facilities more com- 
pletely into war production. 

Along with other producers also, 
however, it has been permitted to 
produce replacement parts for) 
existing automobiles and has de- |

White House Is Getting 
An Enlarged East Wing 


By The Associated Press 

WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
White House permitted disclo- 
sure today that an enlarged east 
wing was being added to the his- 
toric structure. 

Stephen Early, Presidental 
secretary, said it would be used 
for office purposes and would 
balance architecturally the west 
wing now housing all the Execu- 
tive offices. The west wing now 
is crowded with more than 200 
employes, exclusive of the Secret 
Service and White House police 
detail. The police and Secret 
Service will occupy part of the 
new east wing. 

The east wing formerly was 
used principally for cloakrooms 
and a corridor through which 
visitors and sightseers passed in- 
to the Executive mansion.

To Return Open Shop to Nation 


Convention, After Debate, Re-

‘Right to Work,’ and for Con-

By W. H. LAWRENCE 

Specialto THe New Yorn Times 
CHICAGO, April 30—Immediate 
legislation to return the “open 
shop” throughout the United 


States, suspend the forty-hour 


| week and give the Office of Price 


Administration statutory authority 
to control wages and salaries dur- 
ing wartime were urged today by 
the Chamber of Commerce of the 
United States. 

Adjourning its annual meeting,

For the first time in seven years 
a floor fight developed as the cham- 
ber’s resolutions committee, headed 


by Robert E. Campbell of Lincoln, | 


Neb., brought in sixteen resolu- 
tions, only two of which—those 
dealing with wage controls and the 
closed shop—were controversial. 
The chamber’s stand on 
closed shop question went far be- 
yond recent employer suggestions 
that the status of open and closed 
shop contracts now in existence be 
frozen for the duration of the war. 
The resolution, adopted by a 59 to 


14 vote after long debate over an 
even stronger declaration, said in | 


part:

PROTEST NEWSPAPER CURB 


“Artificial limitations upon hours | 


of work should by law be suspend- 
ed during the war.” 

A group, headed by Roy C. In- 
gersoll of Chicago and A. C. Mat- 
tei of San Francisco, and sup- 
ported by Mr. Hawkes, sought a 
stronger declaration which would 
have condemned the Federal Gov- 
ernment for seeking to “federal- 
ize’ labor and would have limited 
labor legislation to the States, but 
their proposal was turned down 

On the wage control issue, the 
chamber’s resolution committee 
proposal was shelved after it had 
been fought by Lammot du Pont, 
board chairman of E. I. du Pont 
de Nemours Company, and Silas 
Strawn, Chicago attorney and for- 
mer president of the chamber. 

As originally offered 
Campbell, the resolution urged that 
“the Price Control Act which gives 
authority for establishment 
maximum prices of commodities 
should be amended to include sal- 
aries, wages, bonuses, commissions, 


and compensation of all kinds paid | 


to all employes for services ren- 
dered, including corporate officers, 
directors and managers.” 
Strawn Assails Proposal 

Mr 
ered the proposal “a very danger- 
ous Statement” and asked the dele- 
gates whether they proposed “to 
turn over to the government the 
running of our businesses and the 
fixing of salaries of everybody?” 

Mr. du Pont said that he was 
“irked most by the idea 
being allowed to pay extra compen- 
Sation for more and better work.” 

“A bonus doesn’t affect prices; it 
reduces the cost,” said Mr. du Pont. 

I. N. Tate of St. Paul finally pro- 


posed a compromise which read as | 


follows: 

“During war times the Price 
Control Act, which gives authority 
for establishment of maximum 
prices of commodities, should in-

This, said Representative 
Vinson, committee chairman and 
co-sponsor, with Representative 
Smith of Virginia, of the original 
and substitute measures, precluded 
further efforts to take to the floor 
bills for statutory labor and profits 
controls. Other committeemen dif- 
fered. 

The Vinson-Smith bill, in what-

from the committee, was key labor

Had it reached the floor it con-

vehicle for a general House show 
down on _ labor-control 
reaching far beyond the scope of 
the legislation as drafted. Oppo- 
nents of the labor provision of the 
Vinson-Smith bill 
mustered their committee votes. 


The death in committee of this | 


measure was held widely at the 
Capitol as having closed the door 
indefinitely upon labor legislation 
in the House. The Senate, while 
having labor measures on its calen- 
dar, is viewed as being in a similar 
position. 

Several members of the Naval 
Committee, looking back upon 
more than two months of testi- 
mony taking from key government 
officials, labor leaders and repre- 
sentatives of budiness and indus- 
try, fought to keep the legislation 
alive, if only for purposes of per- 
fecting some of it and taking what

Unions engaged in printing and | 


delivering newspapers protested 
yesterday against the order of the 
Office of Defense Transportation 
under which newspaper deliveries 
would be limited to one edition 
daily. 

Louis Waldman, counsel for the 
Newspaper and Mail Deliverers 
Union, announced that his organ- 
ization and the Allied Printing 
Trades Council had filed formal 
protests with Joseph B. Eastman, 
director of the ODT. 

“While a mutliple daily delivery

of several editions of a newspaper 
is a necessity to the community, 
particularly in view of the impor- 
tant role of the daily press in 
maintaining public morale by fur- 
| nishing up-to-the-minute and com- 
plete news of war and domestic 
| events. 

“The delivery of a newspaper 
whose contents have been out- 
stripped by events by a full day’s 
time, which a single delivery would 
entail, would deprive a large part 
of the public of that peace of mind 
which is essential today and which 
can only be achieved by keeping

To British Labor which has val-

island into a mighty fortress and in the dark- 

est hours of travail never despaired of the 

final victory! To Soviet Labor magnificently 

fighting in defense of its land against the 
full military might of Nazi Germany! To Chinese Labor 
which for more than four years has freely given of its 
blood for Chinese Independence and against Japanese 


Imperialism! 


Greetings to the workers in the Axis dominated 
countries who daily risk their lives to sabotage and 
disrupt the Nazi and Japanese war machine and who 


look forward to the day of liberation. 


On this May lst, we of American Labor make this 


solemn pledge to you: 


That American workers will toil day and night, with 
all the speed and energy humanly possible, to produce 
the war materials needed by the United Nations. 

That American workers will see that these war ma- 
terials are delivered to every battlefront where we and 
our Allies are fighting the hordes of fascism. 

That American workers will spare no sacrifice and 
endure every hardship to insure the success of a great 
military offensive that will strike at the very core of 
Axis might through the opening of a Western Front on 
the European continent. Such a two front assault upon 
Hitler can bring the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1942 
as a prelude to the destruction of the entire Axis.

strengthen the bond that unites the United Nations, that 
they will fight every attempt of the Axis propagandists 
to divide the world front against Nazi barbarism. 

That American workers will do their all to strengthen 
and cement the National Unity of the American people; 
that they will combat all 5th columnists and defeatists: 
that they will struggle against all attempts of the enemy 
to set class against class, race against race and creed 
against creed. That they will especially champion’the 
rights of their Negro brothers and sisters in industry as 
well as in the political life of this Nation. 

To these ends, we have dedicated our lives and 
everything we hold dear. We have joined our fate 
with yours, and we will not rest until Victory and Free- 
dom triumph. 

And so, on this labor holiday, we reaffirm our solid- 
arity with the labor movements of all Nations, including 
those which have been driven underground by Hitler's 
and Hirohito’s bloody terror. 

Let us intensify our joint éfforts so that by May Day, 
1943, we can celebrate the destruction of the fascist 
enemies of Liberty and Democracy! 


That American workers, in the uniform of the United 


States armed forces, will fight bravely side by side with 
the soldiers of all freedom loving nations until fascism 


is completely destroyed. 


That American workers will do their share

THE NEW YORK TIMES. FRIDAY, MAY 1, 1942 


ee 


Today marks the 34th Anniversary of the founding of the first Terminal Barber Shop and the in- 


troduction of a new way of barbering that has resulted in the development of the largest and most 


popular chain of barber shops and beauty salons in the world. The president and founder of this 


organization has recently acquired sole ownership of it, and more than a thousand employees are 


taking this means of expressing to him, and to their many patrons, the significance of the occaston. 


a 


JOSHPH B. SCHUSSER 


President of the 


Terminal Barber Shops 


tr. Schusser, throughout our many 
years of association you have taught us by your example 
what it means to be an American and to enjoy the 
American Way of Life. You have proven to us that 
opportunity still thrives here, where an itinerant barber 
can by industry, ingenuity, and personality raise him- 
self to the head of a corporation such as this, serving 
hundreds of thousands of discriminating patrons. 
We've learned a great moral lesson from you, 
too. We’ve enjoyed all the benefits of the Golden Rule 
in the form of sick benefits, year-end bonuses, summer 
vacations, group insurance, and many other advantages 
unfortunately not enjoyed by the profession at large. 
And your generosity reached a new high just recently 
when you distributed among us in the form of Defense 


Bonds the entire 194.1 profits of the company—without 
withholding a cent for yourself! 

We’ve shared with you the satisfaction of pioneer- 
ing every new development in the barbering field in 


You Have to Be An American— 
to Understand This Advertisement! 


The Axis will not comprehend it. 


They do not realize what it means to be an American; 
to enjoy freedom of speech and assembly; to determine 
your own destiny and way of life and those of your children. 


Neither will they know why more than a thousand of 
us—barbers, manicurists, hairdressers, clerks—have vol- 
untarily dug into our pockets to express in this way 
how we feel about Joseph B. Schusser and the manner in 


which he has treated us during the past 34 years. 


THIS ADVERTISEMENT tas been 


voluntary popular subscription of the employees of all the Terminal 


these past 34 years—from the day you publicly de 
nounced hair singeing as a fraud up to the more recent 
introduction of dry shaving, scientific scalp treatments, 
suntan shaves, and guaranteed slenderizing services for 
both men and women. 

Of greater importance than all this, however, is 
the knowledge that in you we have a staunch friend 
who after years of well-merited success still calls us 
Joe and Frank and Mary in the same old affectionate 
way—and means it. 

On this our 34th Anniversary, Mr. Schusser, we 
pray that you be with us for many more years, enjoying 
all the benefits of health and happiness you so richly 
deserve. We are proud of you and, as a product of the 


American Way of Life, so may all America,

Roast Leg of Veal Is Suggested as Tops

Things that should be done dur-

clude tending a garden, or,taking 
a walk along a rural road, or 
spending a Saturday afternoon in 
the warm sunshine. Now it is that 


housekeepers, agreeing there is lit- | 


tle time to waste in their kitchens, 
plan streamlined meals. Such, for 
example, is the following simple 
menu, suggested as a model for 
this week’s Sunday dinner: 

Roast leg of veal Gravy 

New potatoes 

Buttered spinach 

Celery and carrot sticks 

Cranberry mousse Coffee 

The veal, it must be admitted, 
will take a couple of hours to cook 
in a slow oven. (Place it in an open 
pan, and allow between thirty and 
thirty-five minutes for each 
pound.) But once the roast is “in”

Veal Prices Little Changed | 

This week-end a leg of veal 
ranges in price from 29 to 38 
cents a pound, with the average 
33, in representative stores about 
the city. This information comes 
from the Consumers’ Service Bu- 
reau of the Department of Mar- 
kets, which points out that all cuts 
of veal are generally unchanged 
from last Friday. Breast and shoul- 
both comparatively inexpen- 
sive, may again be had for 23 and 
26 cents a pound respectively. 
Pork prices also are largely the 
same, though still forbiddingly 
high. Smoked hams, loins and end 
chops all remain at around 38 
cents a pound. 

Beef and lamb, however, register 
changes in the wrong direction | 
and are higher than they were 
seven days ago. Happily, it is the 
more costly beef cuts that ascend- 
ed the price scale, for the plebeian 
chuck steak, at about 27 cents a 
pound, and rib roast, at around 32, 
are steady. But even the budget 
lamb are up, with breast 
penny higher at 16 cents a 
pound, and fores 2 cents more, at 
21. Leg, 3 cents above last Fri- 
day’s figure, ranges from 29 to 34 
and averages 32 cents a pound.

‘Says USO Will Not Encroach| 
Upon Needs of Other War | 


Agencies in Campaign 


in Recreation Centers, 
‘Outposts of Home’ 


— 


Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow, in her | 


women’s division 
New York-USO-Joint War Appeal, 
made it clear yesterday that there} 
should be no encroachment upon} 
the needs of other war service or- 
ganizations in the forthcoming 
USO campaign. 

The quota of the women’s aivi-| 


of the Greater | 
| 





| 
| 
| 


| sion is $750,000 of the $4,450,000 | 


to be raised in the city toward the | 
national goal of $32,000,000. About 
$500,000 of the money subscribed 
here will be used to help finance | 
the New York City Defense Recre- | 
ation Committee and its affiliated | 
agencies, now providing USO aid 
to 200,000 men of the armed forces 
who enter the city monthly. | 
“In this campaign,” Mrs. Mor-} 
row said, “we don't wish to take 
a dollar of money or an hour of 


| time that rightfully belong to the 
|Red_ Cross, 
| Emergency Relief, 


the AWVS, Army| 
Navy Relief or 
l'any other organization that is 


| Working in the war. 
No Time for Competition 


These are no days for competi-| 
tion between war service organiza- 
tions. The USO is an essential war 
service, but there are enough 
money and enough women to go 
around, to make the campaign a 
success, without encroaching on 
other organizations. 


“We are all working for the same 
end—to win the war—although we 
We 
must work side by side with co- 
operation and charity if we hope 
to win a war which is being waged 


| to bring g& peace through understand-

carrying on the USO recreation 
centers, which she called “the last 
extension of home.” She said she 
had heard nothing from service 
men but gratitude for these “out- 
posts of home” where “there is at 
least a little privacy and chance 
to write letters,” as well as nu- 
merous other opportunities to be 
“treated as civilians’ while on 
leave, 
“It is a wonderful chance for 
|} women to continue ‘woman's place 
jin the home,’” Mrs. Morrow ob- 
| served. “Women should have the 
care not only of small children but 
| the responsibility of grown-up chil- | 
|dren, and that is what we have 
with our young men, or boys. Boys 
is a term of affection.” 

Wants Older Women to Serve 

With this thought, Mrs. Mor- 
row believed there should be more 
older volunteer women in the USO 
clubhouses—not to replace young 
girls, however, she explained, who 
attend dances and other programs, 
to add to the 
of the clubs.

she said, 
“but some one told me that if you 
want to be a belle, go to one of 
the camps. You won't be a wall- 
flower. The boys have seen so 
much of youth and some of them 
who are shy feel more comfort- 
able with older women. 

“I have been touched with the 
response of the service men to 
the women of citizens’ commit- 
tees all over the country who are 
working with the USO. The work 
is expanding so rapidly that we 
| will be serving 5,000,000 men be- 
fore the end of the year.” 

Mrs. Morrow, whose headquar- 
|ters are in the Hotel Savoy-Plaza, 
| said she would announce on Sun- 
|day the chairmen of the various 
| committees of the women’s divi- 
|sion’s campaign.

A tropical lipstick attached to a miniature straw sombrero for the lapel 


By MARTHA PARKER 
the products but the | 


Not only 
containers in which they arrive are 
becoming more interesting in 
America these days. An ordinary 
oval box of exceptionally fine face 
powder, for example, appears with 
what seems to be a spool of crim- 
son sewing silk perched jauntily 
on its top. 


A little tug at the end of the 
spool, however, reveals a glossy 
new lipstick, with the same sheen 
and sleek texture as the ruby silk. 
You cannot sew a fine seam with 
this spool, but you can paint a very 
pretty pair of lips. 

The powder in the oval box is 
excellent and has a reputable back- 
ground. It comes in such lovely 
shades as burnt apricot, and one, 
which is even warmer, called 
Basque. Complete with a fleecy, 


|lamb’s wool puff, the lipstick spool 


and a pert satin bow, it costs 
$1. Another capricious item comes 
in the form of a sultry, trop- 
ical lipstick in a copper case, 
topped by a miniature straw som- 
brero. The latter is woven in 
bright confetti colors and is to be 
utilized as an ornament for a Sum- 
mer suit lapel. Pin it to a jacket 
of snowy linen or tuck it in the 
folds of a Carmen Miranda turban. 

As for the lipstick, it is a ripe, 
pomegranate shade, 
good with sun-tanned skins and

the whitest whites. It is a warm, 
rich red—more bronze than orange | 
—with a tendency to make teeth 
look dazzling. The price, including 
the sombrero, is $1.50. 


For that paradoxical problem- 
skin, which is rough and chapped 
and tends to get grimy yet is too 
tender for a good soap-and-water 
scrubbing, there is a very special 
cleanser. 

This subtle product—as_ thick 
and smooth as whipping cream— 
is gentle in its method but thor- 
oughly effective. It doesn’t need 
to be rubbed about in an irritating 
way, yet seems to absorb smudges 
and old make-up with a feather- 
light touch. You pour a small pool 
onto a fresh pad of cotton and 
smooth it over your face. Another 
piece of cotton or a tissue removes 
it again immediately, together 
After 
this gentle washing, a _ sensitive 
skin is soft and smooth, with | 
much of the tautness gone. It is| 
an especially excellent thing for 
removing lipstick from cracked or 
chapped lips. A fairly large bottle 
costs $2.25—and a little bit goes 
quite a long way. A smaller size 
may be had for $1.25.

and guile to prevent South Africa’s staying neu- 
tral. An idealist as well as a politician, he loves 
Africa and dreams of its glorious future. The 
condition of its railroads today required Mr. 
Gervasi to take two days and three nights to get 
from Cape Town to Durbin, about as far as from 
New York to Chicago. Another of Mr. Gervasi’s 
African travel troubles was a temperature at 
Khartum of 132 degrees in the shade, 

Ismet Inonu, the Turkish President but actual 
dictator, is a man slowly losing his balance on 
top of the fence he has been straddling for so 
long. Mr. Gervasi thinks he is getting down on 
Germany's side. Generals Auchinleck in Egypt 
and Wavell in India are described with admira- 
tion both as leaders of men and as masters of 
mechanized war. 

Mr. Gervasi packs into his crowded, rather 
helterskelter book a vivid impression of the desert 
war in Libya, a brief survey of the Jewish-Arab 
problem in the “much promised land” of Palestine,

is as glamorous as a garage and smells like a 


garage.” He also can be hasty and careless and 


overlook such a howler as “Sheridan’s blitz of 


Georgia.” 
® + ~ - 

His book is short, but it covers 36,000 miles 
of the earth’s surface which Mr. Gervasi put 
behind him by plane and ship in 1941. It 
includes a deal of important and interesting in- 
formation which will be new to even the most 
insatiable readers of topical literature. And it 
is pleasantly free from any pretense of master- 
mind thinking or exhaustive, authoritative 
completeness. 

Mr. Gervasi seems to be a man of strong feel- 
ing, acutely sensitive to the atmosphere about 
him, His admiration for the courage and self- 
sacrificing, united effort of the English in Eng- 
land is equaled only by his contemptuous rage 


He can toss off 
a phrase that sticks in the mind, “the simpering 


tion at all, a pointed reference to King Ibn Saud 
of Arabia, who “has remained true to Great 
Britain and the Standard Oil Company of Cali- 
fornia,” snapshot impressions of Thailand and 
Manila. He believes that we should seize the 
Azores and Dakar “by six o'clock tomorrow 
morning” and even Spain and Portugal, that we 
should send huge armies to the Orient and the 
Near East, that our winning of the war depends 
only on our wanting to do so badly enough to 
make the necessary sacrifices and effort. “War 
has Seven Faces” offers you important, interest- 


ing facts, opinions decidedly worth a hearing.

bi THE course of human events it has been 
my duty to write little odds and ends of what 
were supposed to be Japanese History, for one 
can not hope to publish World Histories with- 
out mentioning the unpleasant little people of 
the Nipponese Islands. I am afraid that little of 
what I wrote made much sense, for the literature 
upon Japan, while rich and varied, invariably 
made me feel I was not getting what I wanted 
but a sort of Ersatz of what I wanted. 

And now cometh Joseph Newman's GOOD-

Japanese puzzle was solved, at least as far as I 
was concerned. Those pages added up to some- «J:

JAPAN ON THE BURMA ROAD 


The arrival of Japanese troops at 
Lashio means that the first Battle for 
Burma has been lost. That is a hard 


blow for the United Nations, in some 


ways the hardest of all the blows that 


| we have had to take in five months of 


unsuccessful war in the Far East. For 
Burma, with its oil, is not only a rich 
prize in itself; it is the gateway to 


| China and the only route by which we 
have been able to send supplies to the 


| first and numerically the most impor- 


| tant enemy of Japan.

PATENTS IN WARTIME 


War no British inventors 
may still file applications for patents 
in Germany under the Trading With 
the Enemy Act of 1939 and still pay the 
fees required to maintain their rights. 
Canada and Germany likewise permit 
patent transactions with the enemy. In 
all these warring countries the national 
interest determines whether or not a

that an enemy applicant faces confisca-

tect himself in Germany must obtain a 
license. As yet no licenses have been 
granted, and it is not likely that they 
will be. If they were Americans they 
would stand in a better position in Ger- 
many than do the British, because of 
the treaty of 1909, which exempts them 
from the necessity of working their 
patents there. That the Germans will 
respect the treaty so long as it suits 
their purpose to do so may be inferred 
from their treatment of British in- 
ventors.

TAXES OVERTAKING PROFITS 


Until recently all tabulations of cor- 
poration earnings have shown a sub- 
Stantial year-to-year rise. For exam- 
ple, a calculation by the National City 
covering 2,540 corporations 
showed a rise in combined net income 
for 1941 of 20 per cent over 1940 and 
a smaller sample by the Federal Re- 
serve Board showed an equal rise, This 
was not an extraordinary gain, consid- 
ering the average increase of 27 per 
cent in industrial output which gave 
rise to it; but tabulations of this sort 
have been frequently cited as evidence 


of wartime profiteering and of the need 
for imposing a flat percentage upon all 


profits. Against this argument Treas- | 
ury experts have contended that taxes | 
| already levied and proposed will recap- 


ture excessive wartime profits even 
more effectively than any system based 


upon a flat percentage. The stock mar- 
ket in its decline to the lowest levels 
since 1933 has been, in effect, predict- 
ing that the period of rising profits 
was over and that the future held 
sharply reduced earnings and dividends. 

Now the earnings reports for the 
first quarter of 1942, currently appear- 


ing in the financial pages, are bearing | 


out these predictions, General Motors 


recently reported earnings 64 per cent 
below a year ago; United States Steel 
showed a drop of 28 per cent and West- 


is illustrated by a tabulation the Na- 
tional City Bank has made of the first 


quarter reports of 150 companies. This 


shows that combined net income after 
taxes in the first three months of this 
year fell 16 per cent from the levels of 
the first quarter of 1941 and 29 per 


cent below the levels of the last quarter | 


of last year, although the volume of 


sales was up 26 per cent from a year | 


Taxes provided the explanation. 
Provision for taxes absorbed no 
than 73 per cent of net income before 


taxes, compared with 48 per cent in the 
first quarter of last year, This is a 


trend which will continue. 


When it is considefed that only one- 
fourth of the companies included in the 
compilation made reserves for taxes at 
the rates proposed by the Treasury for 


this year and that these rates run up 
to an effective level of 89 per cent, it 18 


| apparent that the period of rising cor- 


poration profits has reached its end. 
This is, of course, as it should be. There 
is no dispute about the need for high 


corporation taxes in the war period. 


The fact that taxes have now demon- 
strably caught up with rising profits 


should help to clarify the discussions of 
the new tax program and to sustain the 


position of the Treasury that high nor- 
mal, surtax and excess profits rates 
can and will take care of excessive war- 
time profits. 


FLUSHING MEADOW PARK 
Park Commissioner Moses has found 


a way to go ahead with at least a modi- 


fication of the development of Flushing 
Meadow Park as he conceived it years 
ago, when the site was little more than 
a dump and the 1939-40 World's Fair 
was still in the blueprint” stage. 
Throughout the years the Park Com- 
missioner has left no doubt in our 
minds that as far as he was concerned 
the Fair, which most of us look back 
upon from these dark days as a gran- 
diose spectacle of some previous Alad- 
din-like existence, was merely a device 
to hasten the day when the great long- 
neglected Corona-Flushing tract could 
be transformed into a city park. 

With the world at war and with this 
country, its States and its cities trim- 
ming down their wants and needs to 
the barest of essentials, Mr. Moses re- 
fuses to relinquish his dream of the 


Much of the basic work was done in 


the months following the Fair's closing. | 
Now the Park Department announces | 
a $150,000 project which will concen- | 


trate chiefly on play space in the 


Horace Harding Boulevard area, leav- 
ing the previously planned woodland | 


and picnic areas until happier times,

one-fifth of the 1,216-acre tract, will

here—mainly battered asphalt and ran- 
dom building foundations—will finally 
disappear, to be replaced by the ex- 
tensive play spaces, flowering shrubs, 
small trees, perennials and vines. Mr. 
Moses assures us that the work will not 
involve the use of any 
materials.

BOND SALE QUOTAS 


Voluntary Plan Put Into Effect 
for 3,070 Counties, With New 
York City’s Five at Top | 


: MORGENTHAU BACKS STEP) 


| Tammany Hall. 


Early Reports Large Gifts 
From Many Sources 


Special to Tot New YorK TIMES. 
WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
Treasury issued today individual! 
war savings bond quotas for all) 
the 3,070 counties in the United 
States while Secretary Morgen- 
thau pleaded for a fair chance for 


| orary member of the Society of 
|} Tammany, or Columbian Order, at 


|}man of a committee, of which the 





the voluntary bond-selling cam- 
paign and for President Roosevelt’s | 
whole “equality of privilege” pro- 


Mr. 
tain writers were trying to “tor-| 
pedo” the program before it was! 
started. Given a fair chance by | 
135,000,000 Americans, he said, it} 


| would check inflation. He rejected | 


the argument that it left $10,000,-| 
000,000 of new purchasing power 
unprovided for and therefore a po- | 
tential source of inflation. 

It would be apparent by July 1| 
whether the voluntary war bond | 
campaign which was part of the 
program was going to be a suc- 
cess. If it were not, the Secretary 
said, he would be the first to drop it. 

To support his statement that 
the country was ready to give vol- 
untarily, the Secretary read a 
cablegram just received by the 
Navy Department from the Six- 
teenth Naval District in the Philip-| 
area saying that “United 
States Navy personnel in Manila| 
Bay area have purchased war| 
bonds totaling $407,000 to date. 
Amount will presently exceed) 
$500,000.” 

Stephen Early, White House 
press secretary, said that an un- 
precedented volume of voluntary | 
contributions to the cost of the 
war was being received, including | 
one of $75,000. The gifts came} 
from workers contributing extra | 
wages earned, employers and pri- 
vate individuals. 

The Treasury's county quotas 
for bond purchasing range from 
$95,493,000 for the five counties of | 
New York City to $100 each for 
Armstrong County, South Dakota, 
and Daggett County, Utah. Others 
are $38,136,600 for Cook County 
Ill, meaning Chicago, $23,011,100 | 
for Philadelphia County, Pa., | 
meaning Philadelphia 

It was stated by the Treasury 
that Milton Murray, president of 
the American Newspaper Guild, 
Cc. I. O., has been appointed con- 
sultant to the War Savings staff 
and would assist with publicity 
plans for the campaign. 


HAVEMEYER TRUSTS 
PUT AT $33,214,891 | 


Children, Execators of Estates, 
File Statements Here 


Trusts ioteting $33,: 214,891 in the 
estates of Henry O. Havemeyer 
late president and one of the! 
of the American Sugar 
Refining Company, and that of his 
Mrs. Louisine W. Have- 
meyer, were accounted for yester-| 
day in Surrogate’s Court, where | 
their children filed statements in| 
the estates of their parents. 

The children, who are executors,

the wills of their parents, are Hor- 
ace Havemeyer and Mrs. Electra 
Webb, both of Islip, L. L, and Mrs. 
Adaline H. 
ristown, N. J. 

In the estate of 
who died Dec. 4, 1907, they ac- 
counted for two trusts of $8,656,- 
679 each for the benefit of Mrs. 
Freylinghuysen and Mrs. 


his residuary 
equally among his children. He di- 
rected that one-half of the princi- 
pal be paid his son, Horace, on

their father, | 


Webb. | 
Mr. Havemeyer had directed that | 
estate be divided | 





reaching 25 and the income and 
principal of the remaining half be 
paid when he became 35. 

He bequeathed to his widow spe- 
cific real and personal property and 
the life income from a trust to pro-| 
duce an income of $50,000 a year. 
The children share equally in the 
principal of their mother’s trust. 

In accounting for the estate of 
their mother, who died Jan. 6, 1929, 
they reported a principal of $15,- 
352,647 with increases of $129,207 
in the principal account. 

Under the terms of his mother’s | 
will, Horace Havemeyer received 
outright one third, which amounted 
to $2,989,518. The executors re-| 
ported also payment of New York 
estate taxes of $784,047 and Fed- 
eral estate taxes of $269,618. 

The Metropolitan Museum of Art 
received Mrs. Havemeyer’s art col-| 
lection as a memorial to her hus-| 
band. It was considered at the time} 
to be “one of the most magnificent 
| gifts of works of art ever made to 
|a museum by an individual” and 
| was valued for appraisal purposes

Lehman Launches Drive 


For War Bonds Today 


In a drive to sign up investors 
throughout New York State up 
to 10 per cent of their earnings 
in the war savings program, 
Governor Lehman will go on the 
air at 4 o’clock this afternoon in 
what is described by the Treas- 
ury Department as an “unprece- 
dented mass broadcast’—using, 
through direct broadcast and 
transcription, every radio station 
of standing in the State. 

The program was announced 
yesterday by Herbert Schwartz, 
assistant publicity director of the 
Treasury War Savings Staff. 
The Governor will announce that 
from June 14 to 24 a staff of 
300,000 voluntary workers are to 
conduct a house-to-house can- 
vass throughout the State in an 
effort to make 10 per cent war 
bond investment a 100 per cent 
fact in New York, Mr. Schwartz 
said. The original broadcast will 
be over the CBS network, with 
transcriptions thereafter, ending 
with one by WOR at 3:05 A. M. 
tomorrow,

State Medical Society Hears 
Plea for Drive on Disease 


Current statistics indicate a 
trend toward recrudescence of tu- 
berculosis in the present war, and 
now for a new 
health campaign to eradicate the 
disease, it was declared yesterday 


| at the closing sessions of the 136th 


annual meeting of the Medical So- 
of the State of New York 
at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The 
speaker was Dr. Edgar Mayer, as- 
sistant professor of clinical medi- 
cine at the Cornell University 


| Medical College. 


A campaign to eradicate the 
disease, Dr. Mayer said, would 
prevent a repetition of the occur- 
rences of the last war, 

Data obtained from clinical in- 
vestigation of more than 150 pri- 
mary cancers of the lung “justi- 
fy definite optimism as to the 
curability of this type of cancer 
in the future,” 


Mrs. J. Emerson Noll of Port 
Jervis, newly elected president of 
the Women’s Auxiliary to the 
Medical Society of the State of 
New ,York, said that more than 
$100,000 worth of drugs and sur- 
gical instruments were

DIFFICULTIES TODAY

COMPARED WITH 1789 


_MAY_ 1, 1942. 


| Standing on the. ‘steps of the 


| Sub-Treasury Building, at the base 
of George Washington's statue, 
several speakers yesterday com- 
| pared the nation’s present difficul- 
ties with the problems confronted 
on April 30, 1789, when the coun- | 
try inaugurated its first President | 
and proceeded to overcome ob-| 
|stacles much greater than those 
growing out of today’s war. 

Among the speakers who ad- 
dressed about 2,000 persons were 
Rear Admiral Reginald R. Belknap, 
retired, and Rear Admiral George 
H. Rock. In addition, messages 
were sent by Governor Lehman, 
Admiral E. J. King and General 
John J. Pershing. The celebration 
was sponsored by the America's 
Good Will Union, and the Rev. Ed- 
ward L. Hunt, founder of the or- 
ganization, presided. 

In all the speeches and messages 

two points were raised: First, that 
the war being fought today is for 
the preservation, not only of eco- 
|nomic stability, but of the basic 
| rights that a nation must have to 
continue in freedom. Secondly, it 
was stressed that the war will not 
be won easily, but that it will be 
won eventually by the Allied na- 
tions. 

At the close of the meeting a 
group of members of the American 
Women’s Voluntary Services, and 
a descendant of Alexander Hamil- 
ton, showed one way in which 
| civilians can help the armed forces. 
| They unveiled a large painting that 
|dramatizes the drive to sell war 
| bonds.

On how | 


to War Program 


A few in overalls and most of 
them in dusty school clothes, 450 
eager youthful farmers, all city 
| bred, gave pledges to give up their 
|Summer vacations and farm for 
| victory at the Board of Education’s 
experimental farm, on Kissena 
| Boulevard, Flushing, Queens, yes- 
terday afternoon. 

The pledge was taken by the 
| youths in conjunction with the Na- 
| tional Boys and Girls Week. After 
| the ceremonies, veteran farmers 
| from up-State New York watched 
|the high school students demon- 
|strate their skills. Applications 
| from farmers seeking Summer help 
have been arriving at the head- 
| quarters of the experimental farm, 
| Newtown High School, at the rate 
of ten a day. 
| Because of the shortage of farm 
|help, Harrison C, Thomas, director 
of the Board of Education’s “Farm- 
|for-Victory” program, started a 
special training course for high 
school students throughout the 
city. Under the plan, 400 students 
have been coming to the experi- 
mental farm for a two-hour period 
|} once a week. At the end of thirty 
| visits they are expected to have a 
jrudimentary knowledge of farming. 

While the special course has 
| been in operation a regular five- 
|day a week four-year farming 
course, which includes academic 
instruction at Newtown High 
School along with the practical 
work, has been in progress. 

The boys demonstrated their 
technique yesterday at plowing, 
j}using both tractors and horses, 
poultry care, seed planting, gen- 


ing and other general farm chores. 
Witnessing their efforts were J. C. 
| Crowth, director of the Grange Co- 
| operative League Exchange, Water- 
;mill, N. Y.; Harold Eisenhauer, 
| Nassau County district manager of 
the Grange Cooperative League 
|Exchange; Howard Campbell, di- 
rector of the Nassau County 
Farmers Bureau; N. Young, from 
the School of Applied Agriculture, 
Farmingdale, | I., and Harold 
Simonson, a farmer from Glendale, 
L. I. 

Most of the observers were 
amazed that the boys could de- 
|velop their skills to such an ex- 
tent on the fiftv-four acre farm 
|within the city limits. Under the 


direction of John Baker, assistant | 


administrator at Newtown, the 
| youngsters will harvest a 


| crop of strawberries, tomatoes, po- 


| tatoes, corn and apples, peaches, | 


nd grapes.

Consumers will begin registering

|reached at 3:35 P. M. 

This foretaste of Summer was 
;not the only unusual thing about

bent this year on making itself 
|a sort of thirty-day prolongation 
|of the April 1 legend, at the ex- 
| pense of the public. It started out 
| with a minor heat wave, then came 
| back hard with a three-day snow- 
| fall from April 9 to 11. 

While bewildered farmers and 
|gardeners were atill staggering 
|from that, the playful month 
| launched into a dry spell that re- 
mained virtually unbroken until it 
made its exit yesterday. April 
showers? Precipitation from the 
11th to the 30th was no more than 
“a trace,” the weather man an- 
nounced. 

The month’s total, he said, was 
| 1.40 inches—and virtually all of it 
| was snow. In April, 1881, there 
| was only one inch of rain; in 1889, 
| 1.23 inches, and in 1896, 1.24. So 
there was no new record.

On the BMT system wives of 
employes got no free rides, 
did they ride free on the Indepen-

railroads in this area held “Annie

and IRT lines pensioners rétained 
the right to ride for nothing. 

The new pass system eliminates

their passes will be good anywhere

whether the holder works on the

No estimate was available yes-

revenue the city system might ob- 


20,000 free passes. It was said that 
2,000 pensioners and 5,000 railroad 
men, advertising representatives 
and policemen were in this class of

found himself with a group of war

thought it was Nov, 18——he and a

for Sidi Rezegh in two cars while 
the others took another route.

Mr. Genock has been lugging his

General Sessions Jury Gives 


Verdict After Deliberating 
8 Hours 20 Minutes 


* 


A verdict of guilty was handed | 
up early this morning by a blue} 
ribbon jury in General Sessions in | 


the case of nine men accused of 


participating in an extortion con- |

spiracy to victimize 
milk dealers and truckers in New 


York State. The jury before Judge 
returned | 
after | 


James Garrett Wallace 
the verdict at 2:10 A. M. 
having deliberated eight hours and 
twenty minutes. 

Because of the large number of 
defendants, the 150 talesmen from 


which the jury was selected and

hibits introduced by the 
assistant district attorneys, Aaron 
Benenson, Thomas F. Moore Jr.

A mistrial was declared in Jan- 
uary because Judge 
came ill after the first jury was 
chosen. The second trial started 
on March 12 with twelve defend- 
ants. However, three of them, 
Emanual Swidler, Joseph Cohen 
and David Morganlander, were dis- 
charged by Judge Wallace at the 
close of the sixth week of the trial 
on a motion of the prosecutors. 

When the indictment was handed 
up against the twelve last July,

effects |

ninety-six pages, comprising forty- 
four counts of extortion and one of 
conspiracy. This was believed to 
be one of the longest indictments 
in the city’s history. With the 
elimination of three of the defend- 
ants, Judge Wallace threw out all 


but the conspiracy and eleven of | 


the extortion counts. 

The forty-four extortion counts 
had accused the defendants of 
shakedowns totaling $157,800 un-

‘Rauschning Gets First Citizenship Papers; 


| 
| 


| 


Dr. Herman Rauschning, once 


one of the leading citizens of Dan- 
zig, where he was President of the 
Senate, yesterday took out his first 
|United States citizenship papers 
and declared that for him it was a 
“very decisive and favorable mo- 
ment.” 

Forced to leave his native land 
in 1936 because of his hatred for 
Hitler and Nazism, Dr. Rausch- 
ning said he believed that the mo- 
rale of the German people was be- 
iginning to crack under the British 
|air attacks, and because the Ger- 
| mans are no longer sure of what 
| they are fighting for 


| 


| travels from one Furopean nation 


step ahead of the Gestapo with 
each new German conquest. 

He laughed when he was asked 
if he had any private information 
from Germany. The only private 
information he had, he said, was 
contained in letters he received 
|} from Switzerland. His connections 
|with Germany, he added, were 
ended. 

In the middle of the interview,

641 Washington Street. He excused 


‘himself and walked siowly to the 


window to take his oath to a con- 


| stitution, the like of which he has

seen stamped out of many coun- 
tries, including his own. 

When he returned 
naturalization papers, he pointed 
to his picture and chuckled. It 
showed a broad face, with regular 
features “You know,” he re- 
marked, “I live in the city, but I’m 
really just a farmer. My boy works 
on a farm now in Oregon. I should 
like very much 


with his 


|many things.” 


Dr. Rauschning spoke softly, but | 
without bitterness, as he traced his | 


to another as he tried to keep one} 


The conversation then turned to 
the possibility of another German 
offensive

ning to crack but she has strength

ed, Hitler is stronger than before.

Motorists eligible for new tires 
under the rationing program will 
have to get along after tomor- ¢ 
row with recapped tires when 
such a substitute is practical, the 
Office of Price Administration 
ruled today. It added that after |

tires he has in use will not be al-

The rubber shortage dictated 
the OPA decision that no vehicle 
on List A, which includes those 
operated in the most essential 
services, will be considered for a 
new casing if a recapped tire will 
do. However, in the case of vehi-

MARGARINE ISSUE 


SPLITS CLUBWOMEN 


Federation at Fort 
Worth Debates Federal! Tax 
in Sectional Line-Up 


| General 


By LUCY GREENBAUM 

Special to Tus New YorK TIMES 
FORT WORTH, April 30—After 
passing two wartime emergency 
|resolutions, the General Federa- 
tion of Women’s Clubs devoted 
most of its business session today 
to a discussion of oleomargarine, 
Twenty resolutions lived; one died, 


the latter advocating the repeal of | 


|the Federal tax on margarine. 


Delegates voted for a resolution | 


endorsing for the duration of the 
war “the establishment of a sys- 
tem of rationing and price control; 
placing a ceiling on wages; provid- 
ing for control of hoarding and the 
setting of reasonable limitations 
on war profits.” 

This resolution, introduced by 
the West Virginia Federation of 
Women’s Clubs, was adopted be- 
cause of the danger “of a vicious 
circle of rising wage scales and 
costs of living’ and the fear that 
“just methods for protecting the 
interests of all will not prevail.” 

The other emergency resolution, 
introduced by Mrs. H. B. Ritchie, 
chairman of the federation’s de- 
| partment of public welfare, urged 
extension of needed services by 
the children’s bureau of the De- 


| partment of Labor and supported | 


the action of the bureau in seeking 
an increase in budget to 
“acute needs created by a state of 
| war.” 

Sectional Split Occurs 

Dissenters were decidedly in the 
background until the margarine is- 
sue arose. Delegates from the 
| North and South split into oppos- 
ing camps on the question of 
| whether the federation should en- 
dorse repeal of margarine taxes on 
the ground that they were “un- 
fair and discriminatory.” 

Dairy States lined up against 
cotton States (cottonseed oil is an 
|important ingredient of oleomar- 
|}garine). States where there were 
|both dairy and cotton industries 
showed a difference of opinion in 
the delegates’ oratory. 

A motion was made by Mrs 
R. G. Boatwright, president of the 
Virginia State federation, to post- 
pone “indefinitely,” which means 
for the duration, all discussion of 


| the matter. It was accepted by a 


majority. 

Mrs. John L. Whitehurst, federa- 
tion president, had invited spokes- 
men to present the two sides of the 
picture. However, at the last 
minute Charles W. Holman, execu- 
tive director of the National Co- 
operative Milk Producers’ Federa- 
tion, decided not to speak. 

Recount on Close Vote 

The other, Dr. Anton J. Carlson, 
professor emeritus of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago's physiology 
partment, suddenly found himself, 
as representative of the National 

Association of Oleomargarine Man- 
ufacturers, the center of one of the 
stormiest sessions in recent federa- 
tion history. 
| The delegates decided to vote on 
|whether it was fair that only one 
side of the question be presented, 
| whether Dr. Carlson should be per- 
mitted to speak for five minutes. 
“Aves” and were so evenly 
divided that women were obliged to 
stand to record their votes 
first vote of 186 for Dr. Carls 
to 185 against him prompted 
recount, 
210 for, 183 against, and Dr. Carl- 
son proceeded to speak 

Mrs. Harvey W. Wiley, legisla- 
tive chairman for the federation 
and author of the _ resolution, 
headed the group favoring removal 
of the taxes although she is owner 
of a large dairy farm. 

Among the States 
split, their delegates disagreeing, 
was New York Mrs Ww 
Cheney, president of the New York 
State Federation of Women's Clubs 
declared that New York a 
State was opposed to the resolu- 
tion. However, Mrs. Otto Hahn of 
New York said that it was unfair 
to tax American product to 
further the sale of another. 

Other resolutions urged more re- 
ligious instruction in s« hools, and 
opposed the establishment of a 
mandatory joint income tax.

Dom DiMaggio, who played sen-

Peacock led the Boston attack,

DiMaggio’s brightest fielding 
gem came in the ninth when he

DETROIT, April 30 (4)—The 
American League pitching career 
of Lynwood (Schoolboy) Rowe 
came to an end today when the 
Tigers sold the 30-year-old right- 
| hander to the Dodgers 
| Though the price was. undis- | 
closed, it was reported that Brook- 
lyn paid $15,000 to complete the 
| transaction that sent the towering 
| Arkansan to the National League 
|for the first time. He will join the 
Dodgers tomorrow at Pittsburgh. 
| Rowe, who shares with Smoky 
Joe Wood, Walter Johnson and 
|Robert (Lefty) Grove the Ameri- 
|can League record of sixteen con- 
| secutive victories, was starting his 
|tenth season with the Tigers and

Rowe spent one year in the min-

1933. 

The

Manager Mickey Cochrane, 
scored his sixteen straight victor-

lost eight for the season and

moved Kehn and brought in Ed

And so to the Cardinals, behind 
the slick southpaw pitching of 
Howard Pollet, went the deciding 
encounter of the three-game series 
by a score of 7 to 3 

Only four hits fell 
cast and only of these 
before the ninth, when a brief 
spurt, punctuated by a Harry 
Danning triple, yielded three runs. 

Against this superlative pitch 
Hal Schum was 
almost from the outset. Prince Hal 
dropped a tally in the first inning, 
when Jimmy Brown outgailoped an 
infield hit, Bill Werber fumbled 
Moore's grounder and Ray 
Sanders singled to center.

‘Eide Stops Dartmouth Rally

TALCOTT’S 7-2 LEAD CUT

‘Princeton Ties in Seventh of 
Second Game and Scores 
Again in Extra Frame 


Special to Toe New York Tres. 
HANOVER, N. H., April 30— 


Princeton took two long strides to- 
| ward the Eastern Intercollegiate 
| Baseball League championship by 
winning both games of a double- 
header with Dartmouth today. 
The Tigers won the opener by 
7 to 6 and eked out a 6-5 triumph 
in the nightcap. The double vic- 


| four games won against one loss. 
Lanky Roy Talcott, Princeton 
hurler, checked the Indians in the 
early innings of the first game, 
| while his team-mates ran up a 
T-to-2 lead. 
Threat to Victors 


Dartmouth came to bat in the 
second half of the seventh and 
| tant frame and gave the Tigers a 
| scare by scoring four times. The 
| Indians filled the bases and Dixie 
|Daniels, Dartmouth rightfielder, 
| tripled to right field. Talcott was 


| replaced with Lefty John Eide, who | 


| induced Warren Kreter, a pinch- 
hitter, to ground out. 
Eide returned 


;}mound. He waiked Catcher Kos- 
| lowski in the Dartmouth half of 
| the fourth and Bob Mara smashed 
u triple. This frame produced two 
| Green runs, giving the Indians a 


| 3-0 margin. 


Peters Scores McCarthy 


Jack McCarthy tallied for the 
Tigers on Bob Peters’s single in 
| the fourth. Warren Allen touched 
| off a big Princeton fifth inning, in 
| Which the visitors drove three runs 
| across. 
Princeton scored once in the 
| seventh to tie the count and send 
| the contest into an extra inning. 
| Bill MacCoy, Tiger catcher, sin- 
gled in the eighth. Peters made 
a hit and Bob Perina walked, fill- 
ing the bases. Parmer fanned Jack 
Dunn, then slanted a pitch that 
struck the ground next to the plate, 
|The ball got away from Koslowski 
|and MacCoy came in with the win- 
ning run.

Sports of ee Cimes 


Reg. U. B Pat. Off. 


By JOHN KIERAN 


In the Twilight Zone 


and probably little worth bothering about 
will be lost. With the whole country on war 
time, there is enough daylight to go around the 
wide field of sports. For years the golfers have 
been whacking their devious ways around the 
links “in the calm twilight of Platonic shades.” 
Twilight tennis long has been an established cus- 
tom in many communities. The semi-pros in base- 
ball have had their “Twilight Leagues” for dec- 
ades. 

If night baseball, boxing and football are 
blacked out, what of it? On the wartime clock, 
with Summer coming along, there will be a good 
three hours of daylight left over when the offices 
and shops in the towns and cities have closed 
their doors for the day. Let the “night games” 
and the outdoor boxing bouts of peaceful years 
be shifted to that period and all will be well. 
Not only that, but everybody will get home earli- 
er. The baseball clubs and fight promoters will 
be spared the cost of lighting they had to meet 
last year. 

To revise H. Wadsworth Longfellow a trifle: 

Between the dark and the daylight, 

When night is beginning to lower, 

Comes a pause in the day’s occupations 

That is known as the sporting hour. 
Joining Up 

Whatever sports can do to help in the war 
effort should be done not only willingly but en- 
thusiastically. And that’s just the way it is being 
done for the most part. Of course, there are 
some “hard-heads” and slackers, They are to be 
found in all fields. 

Competitive play is hourly improving the 
physique of the youth of this country. The older 


and better athletes who can draw gate receipts 
are contributing sizable sums to the various war 


funds: the USO, the Red Cross, the Navy Relief 


Society, the Army Emergency Relief and dozens 
more. The U. 8. G. A. is sponsoring a nation- 
wide golf program that will keep money rolling 
into these war fund chests as long as golf and 
the war go on together. The United States Lawn 
Tennis Association is playing that same helpful 
game on the courts of this country, Everybody 
is chipping in, and glad to do it. 

It eases the conscience, for one thing. After 
reading the war news, a fellow might be a little 
shamefaced about going out and enjoying a spot 
of tennis or a round of golf. But he feels better 


if, getting a little refreshing fun and needed ex- 


ercise, he is also contributing hard cash to one 
or a dozen war funds. 


Through the Turnstiles 
Horse racing has promised to shovel several 


as G on the blackouts. Much may be saved

millions into the war fund chests. Big league 
baseball is rounding out its schedule for contribu- 
tions. The two all-star games, one in New York 
and one in Cleveland, top the list of attractions. 

It used to be, when the ballplayers were work- 
ing for their own old age and benevolent fund, 
that they played one game a year and the ex- 
penses incident to staging the spectacle were 
deducted before turning over the remainder to 
the “Association of Professional Ball Players of 
The expenses included heavy trans- 
the cost of getting the all-star 


America.” 
portation bills, 
teams together. 

They are doubling the program this year, 
bringing in a combined all-star service team for 
the second game, and cutting out those expenses 
of yore. The club owners will dig down and pay 
all expenses of whatever men are selected from 
their clubs for these games. The contests will 
pack the Polo Grounds and the Cleveland Munic- 
ipal Stadium, and the soldiers, sailors and ma- 
rines will profit by practically every dollar 
clicked up on the whirring turnstiles at those 


big parks. 


Turn and Turn About 


Then there are those home-and-home games 
that all big league clubs =re arranging for the 
benefit of the various war funds, The Giants and 


‘ Dodgers have teamed up. So have the Yankees 


and the Senators and the Braves and the Car- 
dinals. The other clubs are picking partners for 
such war work. 

Larry MacPhail hds been writing letters ask- 
ing everybody to beat the drum for the Dodger- 
Giant game to be played at Ebbets Field on May 
8 for the Navy Relief Society. Larry is wasting 
good white paper. He needn't worry. The Giants 
against the Dodgers in Flatbush and the Navy 
Relief Society getting the gate receipts? That's 


offering a double order of pure pleasure to the 


Flatbush fans. They'll storm the gates. 

All these benefit games in the various cities 
will go over with a bang. Through the Stevens 
clan, every cent spent for scorecards at these 


benefit games in the Boston and New York ball 
parks will go right into the war-fund chests. 
Everybody is giving—and liking it. 


The Parthian Shot 


Mr. MacPhail’s boosting letter, by the way 
contained the following Parthian shot at his fa- 


vorite target: 
“Every one entering Ebbets Field will have to 


pay, from Mayor La Guardia, who already has 
purchased tickets, to the lowest person—the um- 
pire.” Maybe that will start another war.

Three-Point Program 


PITTSBURGH, April 30 (P— 
George E. Little, Rutgers Univer- 
sity athletic director, proposed to- 
day a three-point program of econ- 


omy in athletics whereby colleges 


may meet enrollment and budget 
shortages brought on by the war. 

Little, in an address before the 
Eastern district convention of the 
American Association of Health, 
Physical Education and Recrea- 
tion, suggested: 

1—Elimination of the rule which 
bans freshman athletes from var- 
sity competition. 

2—Arrangement of sports sched- 
ules with colleges within shorter 
distances and doubling up in the 
number of contests normally 
played. 

3—Engaging qualified faculty 
members to help handle certain 


squads operating without coaches. 
Coaches of the ages 20-44 are 


rapidly being taken into the armed | 
|forces, Little said.

out of Brown Rose, the long-shot 
winner had been fourth in a nine-

The executive committee of the 
Turf Committee of America an-

Maryland tracks have subscribed 
to the war fund is not to be their

MACHINERY ISREADY 
TO ENFORCE CEILING 


OPA Spokesman Says Flagrant | 


Violators Will Be Put 
Out of Business 


While the newly organized ma- 
chinery for enforcing the over-all 
price ceilings will not threaten 
businese men with a “big stick” 
there is no question but that a 
number of concerns eventually will 
be put out of business for violating 
the regulation, it was indicated by 
a spokesman for the Office of Price 
Administration here yesterday. 

As in the instance of priorities 
violations of regulations issued by 
the War Production Board, the 
early enforcement will be largely 
a matter of education, but after 
business has had a chance to com- 
ply and if it persists in violations, 
there will be a good deal of action. 
In the instance of the price ceil- 
ings, enforcement will take the 
form of revocations of licenses, in 
flagrant cases, and the concerns 
accused will be put out of business. 

In general, OPA expects enforce- 
ment to be easier in small cities 
and in rural centers, where each 
individual business man is depend- 
ent upon the good will of the pub- 
lic. No organized consumer “‘snoop- 
ing” is contemplated, but consum- 
ers who believe they are being vic- 
timized may complain to local ra- 
tioning boards who will pass on 
information to compliance officers. 

In the larger cities, somewhat 
more elaborate enforcement ma- 
chinery is contemplated. In New 
York, for example, a number of 
full-time shopping experts will 
check price movements. 

Simultaneously, machinery for 
handling hardship appeals is being 
set up, but OPA spokesmen in- 
sisted that the intention is not to 
puncture retail ceilings. Wherever 
in an entire industry retail prices 
are so low as to squeeze retail 
|margins, OPA will seek voluntary 
| reductions on the part of suppliers 
land, failing this, will work out 
orders to achieve the same end. In 
a few instances, if an individual 
|seller has a retail ceiling well be- 
low that of his competitors 
through an odd circumstance, re- 
lief may be afforded, however. 


To Make Diesels for Navy 

BUFFALO, N. Y., April 30 (P)— 
The D-N-X Engine Corporation, 
wholly subsidiary the 
Hercules Motors Corporation, Can- 
ton, Ohio, has leased the Ford Mo- 
tor Company plant here to manu- 
facture Diesel engines for the 
Navy, Charles Balough, president, 
said today. “New machinery and 
equipment will be installed and | 
production will be started within 
five to six months,” he added. 
“When manufacturing gets under 
way we will work day and night, 
seven days a week, because this 
equipment is needed urgently by 
the Navy.”

Laletiadin Could Pay 2 a 
More for Cotton and Earn 
Money, Agency Holds 


—=» -+_— 


COAL MAXIMUMS ARE SET 


Fixed at Top Levels in Period | 
of Dec. 15 to 31—Other 
War Agency Action 


Special to Tae New Yorn Times. 
WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
| Office of Price Administration | 
| said today that there is no reason 
to fear that the cotton textile in- 
austry cannot absorb a further 
limited increase in cotton 
able profits. The assertion was 
contained 
siderations on which OPA based 
its actions yesterday in establish- 


ing price ceilings at the manufac- | 


turing and wholesale levels in vir- 


tually all cotton goods and yarns | 
of 20.37 cents a pound | 


i Aye basis 
ot cotton. 

“The industry's 
margins are wide,” the statement 
continued. “Such margins have not 
been impaired to a negligible ex- 
tent by changes in costs of man- 
ufacturing. Mills were making fair 


profits in 1939 and 1940 and con- | 


siderably greater profits in 1941. 
| Finally, on an individual fabric 
and construction basis, mill profits 
appear to contain considerable 
| ‘water’ and can be appreciably re- 
duced without harm to the mills.” 

The statement was intended to 
|clarify OPA’s position with rela- 
tion to the Price Control Act, which 
says in effect that OPA can take 
no action that will prevent cotton 
farmers from realizing less than 
| 21.47 cents a pound. 

The OPA held that in a great 
number of constructions cotton 
goods mills could pay considerably 
more than 22 cents a pound for 
cotton and still earn substantially 
more than 10 per cent, on the cost 
formula set up by the Price Ad- 
ministrator’s office. Cotton today 
closed at 20.05 cents. It adds that 
there are some cases in which the 
price of cotton could rise close to 
the forty-cent level without seri- 
ous consequences to some mills. 

Other actions by war agencies 
included: 

COAL: Maximum prices which 
may be charged by more than 45,- 
000 wholesalers and retailers of all 
solid fuels were established at the 
highest levels prevailing in the 
period Dec. 15-31, last. Previously 
informal agreements between deal- 
ers and OPA had held prices at 
this level. In another order mine 
prices were fixed for all solid fuels 
not already covered by price sched- 
ules (except wood and wood prod- 
ucts) at levels prevailing in the 
Dec. 15-31 period. 

GOATSKINS: 
raw goatskins, kidskins and ca- 
bretta skins that may be put into 
process by any tanner next month 
was limited to 70 per cent of his 
1941 monthly average by WPB. 

TOTAQUINE: Distribution and 
use of totaquine, a substance made 
up of several of the alkaloids ex- 
tracted from cinchona bark and 
containing some quinine, was for- 
bidden by WPB, except as an anti- 
malaria agent. The order is in- 
tended to prevent evasion of the 
intent of the conservation order on 
quinine previously issued by the 
board. « 

PAPER BOARD: 
prices for specialty paper board 
products and many processed | 
paper board items not previously | 
covered are set at levels prevailing |

Richard J. 


Blum, vice president 


of Saks & Co. and managing direc- | 
tor of Saks-34th Street, and Elliott | 


Beilen of the law firm of Chad- 
| bourne, Wallace, Parke & White- 
| directors of Gimbel Brothers, Inc., 
at the annual stockholders’ meet- 
|ing held here yesterday. 

During the first two months of 
the fiscal year sales increased 26 
per cent over February and March 
last year, Bernard F. Gimbel, 
president, informed stockholders. 
April sales, because of the shift in 
Easter season, have not increased 
in the same proportion as the two 
preceding months, although the in- 
crease is substantial, he said. 

“Earnings such as we have re- 
| cently enjoyed, while adequate for 
| the purpose, constitute but one of 


the prerequisites for the payment | 


of dividends,” Mr. Gimbel declared. 
“Your directors, after careful de- 
liberation, have concluded that, 
faced with the many problems and 
uncertainties introduced by the 
| transition from peacetime to war- 
time economy, the payment at this 
time of a dividend on the common 
stock of our company is not justi- 
fied. This situation will be re- 
viewed from time to time in the 
| light of then existing conditions.” 
The order fixing price ceilings 
will have the greatest effect on the 
company, Mr. Gimbel pointed out. 
What result this will have on earn- 
ings over the balance of the year 
cannot be foreseen, he added, but 
“winning the war comes first and 
we will cooperate 100 per cent.” 
Retiring directors were re-elected. 


OTHER ANNUAL MEETINGS 


Dome Mines, Ltd. 

|< J. H. Stovel, general manager of 
| Domes Mines, Ltd., told stockhold- 
ers at their annual meeting on 
|Wednesday in Toronto that the 
tonnage of ore mined had been re- 
duced to 1,500 tons daily from 
1,700 in order to conserve supplies. 
He said it may be necessary to cur- 
tail operations further, but ex- 
pressed the hope that the company 
may avoid total suspension. Jules 
S. Bache, president, said that divi- 
dends likely will be continued, but 
the rate may have to be reduced. 


National Fuel Gas Company

|Gas Company in January and Feb-

New Financing Prospects 

Activity among investment bank- | 
era was stepped up yesterday by 
the belief that at least three fair- 
sized issues of new securities are | 
shaping up for publie offering this | 
month. The Public 
tric and Gas Company has indi- 
cated to underwriters that it prob- 
ably will consider bids about May 
25 on its issue of $15,000,000 of 
bonds. Competition among invest- 
ment firms for that issue is ex- 
pected to be keen. Philip Morris & 
| Co., Inc., are slated to file with the 
| Securities and Exchange Commis- 
| sion next week a registration state- 
| ment covering $6,500,000 of deben- 
tures and $5,000,000 of preferred 
stock, naming Lehman Brothers 
and Glore, Forgan & Co. as the 
principal underwriters. The pre- 


ferred stock will be offered first to | 
Another | 
deal which has been under discus- | 


common _ stockholders 
sion for some time is also expected 
to go into registration early 


file a statement covering a pro- 
posed issue of $12,000,000 of ten- 
year debentures. Lehman Brothers

Still Another Treasury Call 

| Reflecting the steadily increas- 
ing pace of government expendi- 
tures for war, the Treasury issued 
| | yesterday a new and larger call for 
| funds which it has on deposit with 
|commercial banks. The commer- 
|} cial bank depositaries in this dis- 
trict were notified yesterday that 
the Treasury will withdraw from 
them next Monday $142,842,000. 
Withdrawals for the entire country 
on that day will amount to $266,- 
248,000, or considerably more than 
any of the several calls made in 
the last few weeks. In fact, the 
latest call is the largest in several 
years.

Feb. 25, 1942. Thia may not be the 
last Treasury call before the

| done this month.

in excess reserves for Reserve 
System as a whole, of $70,000,000

Treasury disbursements, which 
pulled down Treasury deposits with

the sharp decline in non-member 
deposits, which reflected the Mor-

Susquehanna Reorganization 

If earnings continue at present 
levels, there is some likelihood that 
the trustees in bankruptcy of New 
York, Susquehanna & Western 
| Ratlroad may give some considera- 
tion to reorganizing it. It is 
likely that the Erie Railroad would 
| emerge from this reorganization in 
| retention of its previous control of 
the Susquehanna, because of the 
status of the Susquehanna’s stocks 
in relation to its senior securities 
In that case, the Erie might make

of the reorganized company, since

Tenders of Cash Corn 


The tenders and retenders of 
cash corn were equal to more than 
10 per cent of the total open inter 
est in that delivery but the exact 
amount the reduction will not 
be known until Saturday. 

There was some buying of wheat 
early on an announcement by the 
Department of Agriculture that | 
the farm parity price of that grain 
on April 15 was $1.3314 a bushel. | 
On the basis of an 85 per cent of 
parity, a government farm loan of 
around $1,121, would be in order 
on the 1942 crop, brokers figure, 
or close to $1.30 a bushel here. 
However, the actual amount of the 
will on the prices 
prevailing late in June 


of

Crop and weather reports con- 
tinue favorable, and brokers are 
expecting that several private esti- 
mates the yield to be given to 
he trade within a day or so will 
indicate a Winter wheat crop! 
slightly in excess of the 625,000,000 
bushels suggested om April 1,

Some Support in Corn 


Despite the heavy selling of corn 
futures by scattered longs the 
market received good support and 
at low level prices were off 
about 1 cent a bushel, Cash houses 
bought the May and sold the de 
ferred futures a liberal scale, 
and a considerable part of the corn 
tendered on May contracts is said 
to have been stopped by cash in- 
terests. 

Stop loss orders were uncovered 

soy beans on the way down, 
especially in the May, with a local 
professional going out of a fair 
sized line on the way down. Octo- 
ber showed the least weakness, al- 
though selling at a new seasonal 
low

Mr. 





Meeting Held at Henderson's | 


realtors from all | 


adopted a resolution | 
unless ceil-| 
jings were also placed on opera-| 
wages and property 





Henderson is empowered, under the | 


Federal Price Control Act, to trans- 
form his recommendations into 
mandatory orders after a sixty-day 
period of grace. Mr. Henderson, on 
Tuesday, set the rent maxima in 
301 localities in forty-six States, 
and in Puerto Rico. 

The National Conference on Rent 
Control here was sponsored by the 
| National Association of Real 
tate Boards and the Institute of 
Real Estate Management at Mr. 
Henderson's request. 
of the two-day meeting this after- 
noon, Robert C. Nordblom, presi- 
|} dent of the institute, offered a re- 
solution urging that the conference 
reaffirm the position taken by the 
national association at its conven- 
tion in November, 1941, which 
| read: 
| “The attempt to control some 
| prices without controlling wages 
land all other elements that enter 
into prices is obviously unfair and 
unsound and cannot succeed, The 
association, therefore, holds that 
any attempt that might be made 
to control rents by law must also 
control all factors contributing to 
the cost of ownership and opera- 
tion of property, including wages 
|and property taxes.” 

The resolution was adopted, as 
was the following one, read by 
David B. Simpson, president of the 
association: 

“We believe that since the Presi- 
dent’s address on April 28, rent 
regulation has become an integral 
part of a much larger program of 
price control to prevent inflation 
in the interest of winning the war 
and that this purpose supersedes 
the use of rent control to remedy 
local rent situations affecting war 
workers only.

CHOSEN IN CONTEST 


24 Little Boys and Girls Take 
Part in Finals of Children’s 
Aid Society Competition 


Twenty-four little boys and girls, 
all fine physical specimens, un- 
| dressed to their underclothes in the 
Jones Center of the Children’s Aid 
Society, 405 East Seventy-third 
Street, yesterday morning and 
lined up before a physician and a 
| nurse. As part of the program of 
| National Child Health Day, they 
| were final contestants for the so- 
| ciety’s crowns for Health Day 
King and Health Day Queen. 

After much weighing, looking at 
teeth and eyes and other forms of 
| examination, and no small amount 
| of giggling by the contestants, who 
;came from six of the society's 
centers in the city, the “king” and 
“queen” were chosen. They re- 
ceived tall cardboard crowns, the 
applause of the other children and 
the prospect of two weeks at a 
Summer camp when they reach the 
age of 7. 

This year’s health king is Car- 
melo Cascio, 5 years old, of 219 
Grand Street, who belongs to the 
|James Children’s Center at 154 
| Hester Street. The queen is 4-year- 
{old Marylin Schultheis of 3038 
|First Avenue and the Avenue B 
Center at 549 East Sixteenth 
| Street. 

The twenty-four finalists, two 
boys and two girls from each cen- 
| ter, were selected from among the 
| 16,000 children cared for by the 
society in congested neighborhoods 
of the city.

Acid Indigestion 


What many Doctors do for it 

When excess stomach acid causes gas, sour stomach 
or heartburn, doctors prescribe the fastest-acting 
medicines known for symptomatic relief —medicines 
like those in Bell-ans Tablets. Try Bell-ans yourself, 
at first sign of distress. They neutralize acid, relieve 
gas, and bring comfort very quickly—yet are not a 
laxative! Only 25¢. at drug stores. If your very first 
| trial doesn’t prove Bell-ans better, return bottle to |

| Calling on all communities and 


|citizen groups to cooperate with 


ithe Federal Government in its ef- | 


forts to provide adequate housing 
for the present and future workers 
in war industry, Mr. Emmerich de- 
clared that low-cost housing and 
islum clearance projects must 
necessarily be relegated to the 
| background “for the duration,” 
| tial materias but also because the 
| winning of the war requires that

Among those present were many 





| leaders in private and public hous-

| during the last ten or twenty years. 
| Former Governor Alfred E. Smith 
and Mrs. Smith, Councilman Stan-

Mrs. Mary K. Simkhovitch were 
among those at the _ speakers’

meeting. 

“Public housing 
gone to war,” Mr. Emmerich said. 
“In the next few weeks and 
months we—and I mean all of us, 
the Federal Government, the pub- 
lic houser and the private builder 
—must achieve a greater rate of 
home production than ever before 

“All these homes are to be for 

war workers. They are war pro- 
| duction. Without them, arma- 
|ments production is bottlenecked. 
| Without them we cannot maintain 
| the production line at full capac- 
| ity.” 
The present goal of the Federal 
|Publi¢e Housing Authority, Mr, 
Emmerich said, is to get 25,000 
houses a month under construction, 
or more than five times the produc- 
tion rate of the old public housing 
program. 

Mr. Emmerich disclosed that the 
| FPHA, because of the emphasis on 
speed in producing houses for war 
industry workers, is building near 
the plants where occupants of the 
homes work and where the same 
public utilities, such as water, sew- 
age and the like, are supplied for 
both the plants and the homes.

Holds His Station and WNYC 
Are Licensed Equally, With 
Ownership Not an Issue 


Mayor La Guardia, 
Wednesday 


who argued 
before the Federal 
that 


on 
Communications Commission 
New York’s municipal radio sta- 
tion should receive a time exten- 
sion to 11 P. M., was in error on 
“at least two points,” according 
to a statement issued here yester- 
day by Earl Gammons, manager 
of Station WCCO, Minneapolis 
WNYC and WCCO share the same 
wave length—830 kilocycles—and 
under the present arrangement the 
New York station goes off the air 
at sundown 

To the Mayor’s charge that 
there are “too many radio stations 
of the Columbia Broadcasting Sys- 
tem in the Minnesota area to be 
wholesome,” Mr. Gammons replied 
that “the fact is that CBS has two 
stations in Minnesota. One is 
WCCO, with a clear channel al- 
located to it under the Havana 
treaty for service to the North- 
west rural population of 7,300,000 
in an area of 320,000 square miles. 
The one other CBS station in Min- 
nesota is KDAL, at Duluth, with 
a limited local coverage.” 

The Mayor’s “second error,” Mr 
Gammons said, was in “‘proclaiming 
that his is a public-owned station, 
operated only for public service, 


‘compared with WCCO being a pri- 


2 
vate enterprise. The Mayor knows 
that both WNYC and WCCO are 
licensed equally in the publi 
est, convenience and ne« 
and must operate wholly 
basis.” 

Mr. Gammons observed also that 
“when it {s considered that WNYC 
has at no time been licensed to op- 
erate after sundown on the WCCO 
frequency and that it once had the 
full-time frequency it ga 
to WMCA here in New Y 
sure New Yorkers will wonder why 
their Mayor doesn’t apply to the 
FCC for assignment of one of the 
many existing full-time wave 
lengths now allotted to priv ately 
operated stations in this area.
