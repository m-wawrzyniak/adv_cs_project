LAGUARDIA SEEKS 
HOUSING POWERS 


Drafts Constitution Change to | 
Provide State Grants for 
Sweeping Program 


Mayor La Guardia announced yes- 
terday a proposed amendment to | 
the State Constitution that would | 
give the State and New York City 
wide powers to provide for low cost 
housing, slum clearance and reha- 
Bilitation of neignborhoods, includ- 
ing provision for adequate streets, 
boulevards, parks, 
ational and other facilities. 

The draft will be introduced to- 


morrow at the Constitutional Con- 
vention by Joseph C. Baldwin, 
chairman of the constitutional com- 


He, 
Roosevelt late | 


mittee on housing of the convention | 
and a City Councilman. The amend¢- | 


ment was drafted by a committee 
appointed by the Mayor consisting 
of Paul Windels, former Corpora- 
tion Counsel; Robert Moses, Park 
Commissioner; Mrs. Samuel Rosen- 
man, Adolf A. Berle Jr., Assistant 
Secretary of State and former City 
Chamberlain, and Adolf Held. 


$200,006,000 Fund Sought 


The amendment, drawn in gen- 
eral terms, would authorize the 
Legislature to make grants or sub- 
sidies and provides specifically for 
authorization of a State fund of 
$200,000,000 with which to launch a 
housing program promptly. 


it the Legislature could grant tax! 


exemptions, authorize a 2 per cent | 
increase in indebtedness of cities 
beyond the present limit, the right | 
of eminent domain of the Legisla- 
ture and cities would be extended 
and zoning powers increased. 

The amendment, authorizing the 


| Legislature to delegate any of its 


powers within the act to any State 
department or agency or to any 
county or city or village or their 
agencies, specifically gives all such 
rights directly to New York City in 
the following words: 

“The City of New York by local 
law may exercise for any such pur- 
pose within such city any of the 
powers herein granted to the Leg- 
islature.”’ 

By this direct authorization the 
city would not have to await action 
by the Legislature before exercising 
its new powers. This new author- 
ity would include wider powers of 
excess condemnation and allow the 
city to raise housing funds by in- 
creasing its indebtedness up to a 
maximum of 2 per cent of the as- 
sessed valuation of real estate more 
than the present 10 per cent limi- 
tation. 

In a statement accompanying the 
draft Mayor La Guardia indicated 
that housing funds would not be 
raised from real estate taxes but 
from ‘“‘new sources of revenue.”’ 
B:fare releasing the statement and 
draft, the Mayor conferred in the 
morning with Mr. Berle and Mr. 
Windels. Reuben A. Lazarus, long

Special to Taz New Yorn Trurs 


| PHILADELPHIA, April 30.—Be- 
cause of a Supreme Court decision, 
the National Labor Relations Board 
is ‘‘seriously considering’’ the re- 
scinding of orders against the Re- 
| public Steel Corporation and the re- 
| opening of the Republic and several 
| other cases under a modified prece- 
|dure, the board’s general counsel, 
;|Charles Fahy, disclosed today to 
|the Federal Circuit Court of Ap- 
| peals. 
The unexpected announcement 
| was made as Republic Steel carried 
|to this court its appeal from a 
board ruling of April 9, which held 
the corporation responsible for the 
deaths of three strikers at Massillon, 
Chio, during the C. I. O.'s “‘Little 
| Steel” strike last July, and ordered 
the reinstatement of 5,000 striking 
employes with back pay. 
| Mr. Fahy came her to ask the 
| Circuit Court postpone for a 
| weelt a hearing on the appeal. The 
| three judges, Joseph Buffington, J. 
| Warren Davis and J, Whitaker 
| Thompson, refused the request, re- 
| eeived the petitions and arguments

board's determination of 
course. 

The possibility that the Republic 
and other cases may be thrown 
wide open again results, according 
to Mr. Fahy, from the Supreme 
Court’s ruling Monday in the Kan- 
sas City stockyards case, in which 
the court passed on rules of proce- 
dure for administrative bodies. 

In that case the Supreme Court 
held that Secretary Wallace had ac- 
cepted as his own the findings of 
the “‘active prosecutors for the gov- 
ernment’’ and had not given the 
packers the right to a full and fair

involved establishment of maximum 
rates for livestock sales commis- 
sions in Kansas City

There are no reporters aboard the

“‘shake-down run’’ in which the 
new-type ship is to be put through

Not all her ordnance has yet been

among those who watched him from

interest in the vessel’s guns and 
general performance. 

The first information about the

newspaper correspondents stationed 


at Charleston tonight, showing that | 


the President was proceeding in a

only 22 knots, in contrast to her

Mr. Bow, on hearing this, pressed 
forethe granting of his petition, 
saying that ‘‘We have no one to 
look after our side of the matter.’’ 

“We are not company unions, 
nor are we dominated or controlled 
in any way by the comipany,’’ he 
said. ‘‘In our ranks at the pres- 
ent time are many members who 
were employed after the strike, 
and who have contractual relations 
with the company that must be 
protected.

is Means that thousands of men who 
were given the opportunity to re- 
turn to work, and who refused to 
accept, could be put back at the 
expense of these men losing their 
jobs, and we protest against it.’’ 

Mr. Fahy said the board would de- 
termine its course within a week. 

Its order upon the Republic Cor- 
poration specified that the 5,000 
striking employes be reinstated with 
back pay from April 8, the date of 
the order, les sother earnings, upon 
their application. 
of Twenty-seven emplSyes alleged to 
have been dischaiged for union 
activity were ordered reinstated 
with back pay, iess other earnings, 
for the period May 4 to May 25, and 
ip the company was instructed to com- 
pesate the employes of the Canton 
tin plate miils and the Masillon 
works for wages lost from May 19 
to May 25 . ecause of the shutdown 
of these plants. 

The appeal of T. M. Girdler, chair- 
man of the board of the company, 
for a stay against the order was 
heard here because the steel com- 
pany is chartered under the iaws of 
Delaware, and so comes within the

Mr. Thomas returned to Jersey City later on a for failure to check ‘international 


| fascist brigandage’’ in Spain, China 
| and Austria, telling ‘brother work- 
jers’” that “it is a cynical lie to say 
|these countries cannot check such 
| aggression.” 

| “They can check this brigand- 
|age’’ says the manifesto, ‘‘but for 
|this it is necessary to accept the 
|proposal of the Soviet Union for 
|joint action against the war-mon- 
gers by all States that are inter- 
ested in the preservation of peace. 
| They must reinforce action by 
measttres of economic pressure. Let 
ithe fascist bandits be deprived of 
|ecredits; refuse them the raw ma- 
lterials that are necessary for con- 
iducting war; close the channels of 
| trade to them. 


Asks Aid for Republican Spain 


“Cease blockading Republican 
| Spain. Open the borders and let 
the Spanish people buy armaments 
ifreely. This would be enough to 


| dog.”’ 

The manifesto is specially critical 
lof ‘“‘the reactionary circles of Eng- 
llish Conservatives’’ and ‘‘the reac- 
tionary French bourgeoisie,’’ which 
|it holds responsidle for the aggres- 
| sions by the fascist States. 

| Appealing directly to the Socialist 
and trade union internationals to 
take common action with the Com-

| Loyalist Spain, the manifesto de- 
| clares:

PARIS, April 30.—Paris will cele- 
brate May Day tomorrow without 
newspépers, without taxis and with- 
out some of its varied amusement 
facilities. But most of the essen- 
tial services will operate and no 
disturbances are expected. 


Workers in most cases will go on 
picnics in the suburbs, where there 
will be as many as forty different 
laber gatherings. The biggest dem- 
onstrations will be staged in the 
afternoon, when there will be a pa- 
rade of workers to an outdoor mass 
meeting at Vincennes, which will 
be addressed by Léon Jouhaux and 
other labor leaders. 

No newspapers will be published 
er placed on sale in the Paris re- 
gion, it was. announced by union 
newspaper employes. Taxis have 
been ordered to cease service at 6 
A. M. tomorrow and not to resume 
until 5 A. M. Monday. This strike 
will be only partial, as usual, as it 
affects only employed taxi drivers, 
and those who own their own cars 
will in many cases keep operating 
throughout the day. 

Dance halls and cabarets will be 
closed all afternoon but will open 
in the evening. Motion picture 
theatres will stop their perform- 
ances for fifteen minutes at 4 
o'clock. Theatre managers have 
announced matinees, but the me- 
chanical staffs and stage hands will 
be absent and actors will have to 
perform without their help. nve- 
ning programs will go on as usual 


French Troops Get Leaves 


PARIS, April 30 UP).—The French 
Army, traditionally kept in its bar- 
racks over May Day te guard 
against riots, received permission 
today for its usual Sunday leave 

This presaged a French 
May Day celebration 

Violent storms swept France on 
the holiday eve. Snow heavily dam- 
aged crops in Eastern France. 


50,000 Will March 


| LONDON, April 30 ().—Remem- 
bering past May Day clashes be- 
tween Leftist workers and Sir 
Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts, Lon- 
don authorities today canceled Sun- 
day leave for hundreds of police- 
men. 

Upward of 50,000 paraders under 
the auspices of the Labor party and 
the Trades Union Congress will con- 
verge on Hyde Park in six columns 
for the day’s big rally under the 
slogan ‘‘Arms for the Spanish Gov- 
ernment.”’ 

Sir Oswald’s small blackshirt 
band will march through hostile 
districts for its own meeting. Sir 
Oswald has dropped the word 
‘Fascists’ for the name of the or- 
ganization, which is now ‘British 
Union.”’ 

Last Oct. 3, at the fifth anniver- 
sary parade of the Blackshirts, 113 
were arrested and thirty hospital- 
ized after a clash with anti-Fascists. 
A few days later at Liverpool a 
Leftist struck Sir Oswald on the 
head with a rock and sent the 
Blackshirt leader tc the hospital 
with a slight concussion 

He is back in action, however, and 
has laid plans for a parade and 
meeting tomorrow in Bermondsey, 
on London's East Side. 

The Labor groups will hold their 
gatherings in the afternoon and the 
Blackshirts in the evening. 

The chief danger, though, and 
the only one that seems to bother 
Scotland Yard most, is the possibil- 
ity that the two groups may tangle 
eisewhere. The Labor followers 
have received permission to con- 
verge on Hyde Park by various 
routes, while the Blackshirts have 
received approval for a line of 
march striking four miles into the 

|East End, where Communist sup- 
|port is strong. 

Police fear some incident aiong 
the route might touch off a free-for- 
all. 


3,500 C. I. 0. MEMBERS 
PARADE IN NEWARK 


Speakers “fe Tuan and 
Plead for Labor Unity 


Special to Taz New Yorx Times 

NEWARK, N. J., April 30.—At- 
tacks on Mayor Frank Hague of 
Jersey City and pleas for better 
housing, more jobs and adequate 
relief featured a peaceful May Day 
march of 3,50C C. I. O. unionists 
down Broad Street here today. The 
marchers, assembied in Military 
Park, heard speakers plead for 
A. F. L.-C. I. O. unity to strengthen 
the labor movement. 

A banner showing Mayor Hague 
palanced on the shoulders of Hitler 
and Mussolini and captioned ‘‘It 
Can’t Happen Here” was on an 
auto leading the march. In the 
park William J. Carney, C. I. O. 
regional director, said John R. 
Lengo, anti-Hague Democrat, is 
‘innocent’ of the charge of election 
fraud for which he is now being 
tried in Jersey City. 

Harry J. Wendrich, chairman of 
Essex’s Labor Non-Partisan League, 
pointed out that while Jersey City 
authorities had refused to allow the 
Young legislative election inquiry 
committee see the city’s poll booxs, 
they were produced for the Longo 
trial. Twenty-six unions and ten 
fraternal organizations participated 
in the demonstration. 


to =ascist Workers 

ROME, April 30 (P).—May Day 
will be just another Sunday in 
Italy. Premier Mussolini linked 
May Day with the anniversary of 
the founding of Rome celebration 
April 21. 

fay 1, as the labor day of most 
of Europe, has a leftist tinge intol- 
erable to the Fascists. 

It went into the limbo of dead 
fiestas in Italy years ago when the 
Fascist bleckshirts won a bitter 
struggle with Socialists, Commu- 
nists, Republicans and other polit- 
ical rivals.

OWN LOCAL OF U. A. W. 


Quit Parent Flint Valen —Dolay 
in Dues Picketing Voted 


Special to Tas New Yorn Truss 

FLINT, Mich.. April 30.—Mem- 
bers of the Buick division of the 
United Automobile Workers of 
America voted tonight to withdraw 
from Local 156, the parent body of 
the U. A. W. A. in Flint, and form 
their own loca] 

Fisher Body No. 1 local was formed 


several weeks ago after a with- : 


drawal from the parent local, 
which was once the largest unit of 
the international. 

Edmund P. Geiger, secretary of 
the Buick division, which claims a 
membership of more than 6,500, 
said that tonight's decision was by 
a <°-to-1 vote. 

The. decision was interpreted as 
indication that the more aggressive 


members were in control. Griev- | 


ances have been presented to the 
Buick management for discussion, 
Mr. Geiger: announced. 

Left in the parent local are the 
Chevrolet division, the controllifg 
group, and workers of Fisher Body 
plant No. 2, the A. G. Redmond 
Company and the Standard Cotton 
Products Company 

The Buick and Chevrolet unions 
voted to postpone picketing sched- 
uled for Monday in the dues-col- 
lection campaign 


COLUMBIA DEDICATES 
COAST RADIO CENTER 


Roosevelt Letter Read, Roper 
Heard in Air Ceremony 


Special to Tur NEW Yorx Tres 
HOLLYWOOD, Calif., April 30. 
With nineteen hours of broadcast- 
ing provided by fourteen programs, 
the new Pacific Coast headquarters 
of the Columbia Broadcasting Sys- 

tem was opened today 

During the dedication of the 
$1,750,000 Columbia Square Air 
Center, William S. Paley, head of 
the system, read a letter from Pres- 
ident Roosevelt congratulating him 
upon his announced policy of mak- 
ing the facilities available as ‘‘1 
forum for presentation of both sides 
of public questions.”’ 

“Only through free and untram- 
meled discussion can sound public 
opinion, so essential a force in our 
democratic form of government, be 
achieved,’’ the President wrote. 

Among the speakers was Daniel 
C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, 
who commended advertising as ‘‘the 
best of all ‘pump-priming’ in the 
category of business,’’ important in 
“business recovery and stability.’’ 

Another speaker was Governor 
George Earle of Pennsylvania. Sci- 
entists, composers and notables of 
the screen and radio were also 
heard

Yesterday was the last day on SE 
which the taxes for the first half | 
of the year could be paid without 
the 7 per cent yearly penalty. Ad- 
ditional returns mailed yesterday, 
which will be received tomorrow, 
will swell the total considerably. 

Many property owners paid their 
taxes at the borough offices of the 
City Collector. In Brooklyn the of- 
fice was crowded until late in the 
afternoon 

The increased collections were at- 
tributed to the higher tax wand 
which makes the taxes greater than 
jast year The 1938 basic rate is | 
$2.80, as against $2.64 last year, Of | 
the total collections reported yester- 
day. $183.713,470 were on account 
of the first half of the 1938 levy, 
and $41,071,505 on the second half. 
Payments on the second half re- 
ceived a discount at the rate of 4 
per cent a year. : 

On the corresponding date last 
year the total collections were $218,- | 
943,753, of which $174,155,279 was 
for the first half and $44,788,474 
for the second half. Comparison 
of these totals showed that first 
half collections this year were 
$9,558,191 more than those of last 
year, but second half collections 
were $3,716,969 less than last year’s. 

Collections by Boroughs 

William Reid, City Collector, re-

in which he was declared in con- 


tempt of court for failure to appear 
at a hearing before trial of a $100,- 
000 civil action, later was an- 
nounced to have been attacked by 
mavauders the night before the 
hearing, and finally heard the date 
of his criminal trial set for May 5. 

The trial of bribery charges had 
been once postponed, when he suf- 
fered a heart attack aboard a train 
at Syracuse 

The character of Zimmermann’s 
illness was announced by Mr. 
Twelvetrees, who said his state- 
ment was based on a tentative 
diagnosis made by the former 
Mayor's brother, Dr. Edward J. 
Zimmermann. 

First announcement that Zimmer- 
mann was stricken came from Dr. 
Varco, who said that a priest had 


| administered the last sacrament to 
the former Mayor. 

Members of the household told 
Chief Whalen that Zimmermann 
collapsed in the bathroom at 8:30 
o'clock this morning. 

Meanwhile, the first 
talesmen had been drawn for the 
jury which will try Zimmermann 
next week on a 
ment charging the accepting and 
soliciting of bribes in connection 
with a $15,000,000 sewer project. 


Police Head Hits ‘Curb Cruisers’ 

BUFFALO, April 30 (1.—Police 
Commissioner Glenn H. McClellan 
today ordered a drive against ‘‘curb 
cruisers’’—those motorists who ac- 
cost unescorted women while they 
walk along the city’s sidewalks. He 
branded them as ‘‘the lowest form 
of humanity, contemptible fellows 
not fit to be at large, a source of 
annoyance to unescorted femaies.’’

BRIDGEPORT, Conn., April 30.— 
The Merritt Parkway iand situation | 
‘cannot happen again’’ in Connecti- 
cut, Governor Cross told the bien- 


nial convention of the State Federa- 
tion of Democratic Women today. 
The Governor, speaking twenty- 
four hours after he had forced 
State Highway Commissioner John 
A. MacDonald out of office on the 
parkway grand jury’s recommenda- 
tion and had appointed William J. 
Cox, Assistant Professor of Engi- 


ment of Mr. Cox. 


“Under the reorganization effect- 
ed by the last General Assembly,” 
| the Governor said, “it never again 
| will be possible for one man to 
spend $20,000,000 a year as he 
likes."’ 


Under the new law, all major ex- 
penditures were subject to the Gov- 
ernor’s approval, he added. 

“It requires a young man to do 
| this work,"’ he continued. ‘You 

have heard that the Highway Com- 

missioner has resigned and a new 

| one has been appointed, all between 
'9 A. M. and 5:30 P. M., after I

Meanwhile, State's Attorney Lorin 
W. Willis turned over to State} 
Police bench warrants based on 
secret indictmenta by the grand 
jury in connection with charges in- 
volved in the expenditure of $6,176,- 
000 for the parkway right of way 
through Fairfield County 

Arrest of persons out of the State 
will be made before arrests are 
made in the State, he said. The 
jury wound up a three-month in- 
vestigation Thursday with a recom- 


mendation for Mr. MacDonald's re- 
moval from office on grounds of in- 
competency.

A resolution “‘asking for the ap- 
pointment of a committee to con-| 
sider the whole question of the) : 
present archdeaconry system’”’ of 
the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of 
New York will be submitted at the 
coming diocesan convention, it was 
announced yesterday at the office 
of Bishop William T. Manning at | 
the Cathedral of St. John the 
Divine. 

a Decision to offer the resolution | 
was taken at a meeting yesterday | 

as of Bishop Manning, Charles K. Gil- | 
‘ bert, Suffragan Bishop, and a com-| = 

mittee appointed by the Archdea- |= 
conry of Westchester County. The 
committee was named at a meeting 
last week at which the mission sit- 
uation in the county was discussed. 

The announcement from the/=z 
cathedral read, in part, as follows: 

“The committee made it quite 
clear that the action taken at the} 
archdeaconry meeting was not in| 
any sense a criticism of the admin-| 
istration of the missionary work | 2 
either by Bishop Gilbert, who is| = 
Archdeacon, or by Bishop Man- 
ning 
“After a full discussion of the | 
questions involved, Bishop Man- 
ning suggested that a _ resolution | 
should oe offered by Bishop Gilbert, | 
at the coming diocesan convention, 
asking for the appointment of a 
committee to consider the whole 
question of the present archdeacon- 
ry system of the diocese and to re- 
port at the next convention. This | 
Suggestion was unanimously ac-| = 
cepted and such a resolution will 
be offered at the convention by| 
Bishop Gilbert.’’

Michigan Unit Replaced 


The First Pursuit Group at Sel- 
fridge Field, Mt..Clemens, Mich., | 
will not participate in the manoeu-| 
vrex, as originally scheduled, due 
to changes being made in engines. | 
Vie War Department denied re-| 
perts that the decision was due to 
crashes at Selfridge Field or that 
there had been any more crashes | 
here than at any other field. 

“The development of the new 
American pursuit airplane with) 
which the First Pursuit Group is} 
equipped,” the War Department) 
said in explaining its order holding | 


|}the First Pursuit Group at Self-| 
|ridge Field, ‘‘has made possibie so} 


much higher speeds and so much} 
more violent aerial manoeuvres 
than could be performed in the old- 
er types of aircraft that some of 
the engines in these ple.es, which 
have given satisfactory service in 
the other types, have developed cer- 
tain troubles when subjected to the 
strain of aerial combat in these 
modern planes. Improved parts 
which will remedy this undesirable 
condition have now been manufac- 
tured. . 

“In the interest of economy of 
operation as well as safe flying, the 
participation of units equipped with | 
these airplanes in tactical opera-| 
tions has been temporarily sus-| 
pended until the engines can be dis- 
mantled and the improved parts in- 
stalled.”’ 


Selfridge Field Craft Grounded 
Special to THE New Yor« TIMES, 

DETROIT, April 30.—An order} 
from. the War Department today 
grounded Seversky pursuit planes 
of the First Pursuit Group at Sel- 
fridge Field. Their engines will be 
torn down next week. | 

Selfridge Field fliers have been | 
involved in four accidents, two of | 
which resulted in fatalities, in the 
last few weeks. The accidents were 
attributed to engine failure. 


At Mitchel Field it was learned 
from an authoritative source that | 
the Selfridge Field Seversky pursuit 
planes were grounded because of 
trouble with the engine bearings. 

The planes are powered with twin- 
row, fourteen-cylinder Pratt & 
Whitney engines; it was said, in 
which a new type of alloy was used 
in the bearings. 

The Seversky ships, which have a 
top speed of about 290 or 300 miles | 
an hour, have but recently been put 
into service. As the engines be- 
came broken in it was discovered 
that the bearings tended to ‘‘freeze | 
up”’ in the air. The result was that | 
the engines were slowed down cone | 
siderably, a condition which added 
danger to landing. 

Silver cadmium bearings, of the 
type generally in use in the past, 
will replace the present bearings.

MACY § second annual SHOW and SALE of 115 superb handmade} 


American Patchwork QUILTS. 


Last year Macy’s scored a triumph with its first show of 
this native art. In the past 12 months we have gathered 
together a second collection of hand-made patchwork quilts, 
even more beautiful than our first. Each quilt is the “heir- 
loom” or “dowry” handiwork of an American woman who 
js an artist in her craft. Each is of a quality to “make” a 


room or to enrich a private collection. 


About 25 handmade 


The prices are astonishingly low... from 19.98 to 64.50, de- 
pending upon the intricacy of the work. In some cases we 
have been able to secure pairs. If you wish special color com- 
binations and a special size we can have most of the quilts 
shown made to order for you. So that everyone may see the 
whole collection, no quilt purchased will be delivered be- 
fore May 11, though they will probably be sold (as they 
were last year) in the first few hours.

Another measure on which action 
was not taken was the bill giving 
the government the right to pur- 
chase the Rio Blanco hydro-electric 
plant from the Puerto Rico Rail- 
way, Light and Power Company, a 
Canadian-owned company operating 
under a franchise. 

The Senate failed also to act on 
its bill to dissolve corporations

in violation of a law passed in 1900. 
The bill was contingent on the gov-

Two measures strongly urged by 
Governor Blanton Winship to pro-

The Legislature passed a $17,000,-

teachers. This contrasts with the

PROTESTANTS UNITE’ 
AT FRENCH PARLEY 


Principal Sects Band Under 
Constitution to Go Into 
Effect Jan. 1, 1939 


AID OF ALL PASTORS ASKED 


Federation President Says the 
Need for Moral Recovery Led 
to Meeting’s Success 


Wireless to THE New York TIMEs. 

PARIS, April 30.—A constitution, 
which will lead to a union of the 
principal Protestant sects in 
France, was adopted at the Prot- 
estant Assembly held this week at 
Lyons. At the close of the meeting 
a message from the delegates was 
addressed to all the pastors of these 
sects giving notice that the Union 
of Protestant Groups will go into 
effect on Jan. 1 next year. 

The decision affects four separate 
Calvinist groups known as the 
Union des Eglises Reformees de 
France, the Union des Eglises Re- 
formees Evangeliques, the Union 
des Eglises Evangeliques Libres 
and the Leglise Methodiste de 


t ahde tee France 


The work of unification will be 
carried out with the assistance of 
the existing coordinating body of 
the Protestant Federation of 
France. 

“We came to Lyons,’’ says the 
message to the pastors, ‘‘in the con- 
viction of obeying God’s will in put- 
ting an end to our divisions, which 
are based on questions of con-

WHEAT IS EXPORTED 


FROM FRANCO SPAIN 


War Cuts Off Home Market—- 
Price-Spread Between Grain 
and Bread Is Small 


TRADITIONALISM DEFINED 


‘inspiration’ of State Operates 
as ‘a Point of View Rather 
Than a Program’ 


Ry HAROLD CALLENDER 
Specie! Correspondence. THE NEW Yorx Times 
BURGOS, Spain, April 20.—One 
of the singular results of the civil 
war is that Franco Spain has be- 
come for the time being an ex- 
porter of wheat The explanation 
is that Republican [Loyalist] Spain, 
containing the three largest Spanish 
cities, embraces the principal indus- 
trial zones and hence is a consumer 
of wheat while Franco Spain, 
mainiv agricultural, is a producer 
of wheat It is said in Franco 
Spain there is a wheat surplus at 
present of 8,000,000 quintals, so the 
area can afford to export some be- 
cause the normal! internal market 
is on the other side of the military 
ijiine 

Since wheat is the basic crop of 
Central Spain it was necessary to 
control the price Consequently 
wheat has been taken as the prod- 
uct with which the projected gyn 
dicalist State made its first experi- 
ment in that type of controlled 
ecomomy 

The experiment began last August 
with a decree setting forth in de 
tail how wheat production and sale 
should be organized and the price 
fixed through the National Wheat 
Service Thus Spain, like Italy 
began ‘‘battle of wheat,”’ although 
in Italy the aim was to increase pro- 
duction to insure self-sufficiency in 
wartime, while in Spain it was to 
yrotect the farmer by an assured 
price and to insure adequate crops 
for war and export 

About 22,000,000 quintals of wheat 
is expected to be produced this year 
in Franco Spain, with a margin for 
export, although before the war 
Spain imported wheat to supple- 
ment her own output 

Dionisio Martir Under Secretary 
of Agriculture, who is a farm spe 
cialist, directe the National Wheat 
Service According to him, _no- 
where is the price of bread so hear 
the cost of production, nowhere is 
the cost of intermediate services 
between the farmer and consumer 
s0 low In a typical district, he 
says, the priee of wheat is 58 pesetas 
and the price of flour 67 pesetas 
The price of bread has not changed 
since November. 

Speculation has been eliminated, 
he states, while the farmer is get- 
ting a fixed price and requires no 
credit Prices will be fixed this 
year in advance, he points out, so 
the farmer knows before planting 
exactly what his revenue will be. 

The price-fixing is done by pro- 
vincial committees—including repr 
sentatives of the National Wheat 
Service, farmers, workers, millers 
and bakers—according to a fixed 
formula taking into account the 
price of bread, profits of the miller 
and baker, wages, etc. The National 
Wheat Service then buys wheat and 
sells to the miller, both farmer and 
miller being obliged to deal through 
this service.

LONDON, April 30.—Sir Auckland 
Geddes, former Ambassador to 
Washington, jave the shareholders 
|of the Rio Tinto Mining Company 
| yesterday his forecast of the situa- 
tion in Spain if General Francisco 
Franco sweeps the country. 

Speaking as chairman of the com- 
pany controlling vast copper mines 
near Huelva, which, in exchange 
for ‘‘frozen’’ pesetas, or promises of 
pesetas, has already delivered to 


amounting to £1,750,000, Sir Auck- 
land said: 
“TI doubt whether Spain would ac- 


Franco wins, is something new, 
something different, something 
Spanish.’ 

He complained of “arbitrary in- 
terference’’ with marketing and 
shipping arrangements and referred 
to the veto on exports of pyrites to 
France and Czechoslovakia im- 
posed by the Insurgents for purely 
political reasons. 

“Far from suffering from the in- 
tended handicap,” he said, ‘‘these 
countries have been able to cover 
their requirements from other 
sources, whereas the Spanish pro- 
ducers have been depriyed, perhaps 
for years, of important markets.’’

latter contributing the “Tradition- | ma

fascist in its outlook and aims, | 

closely resembling its precursors in | 

Italy and Germany, yet differing | 

from them in some respects, ac-| 

cording to Sefior Cuesta, who said | 

the present membership was more | 

than 1,000,000, although the Falange| 

was organized only in 1933. 


Movement Grew Rapidly 


The movement grew rapidly when | 
the civil war began and Nationalist | 
forces were mobilized against the} 
so-called ‘‘Red’’ republic, for the} 
Falange quickly became the popu- | 
lar expression of the Franco cause. | 
No limit has yet been placed on| 
membership, but it may be restrict- | 
ed after the war, save for the new 
generation of youths. 
“The Falange is a movement, not! 
a party,” said Sefior Cuesta. “It is| 
not a State, but an inspiration and | 
the nervous system of the State, and 
guardian of the national revolution. | 
In Germany the party is above the| 
State; in Italy it is subordinate to| 
the State, but in Spain it is neither. | 
The State is static, but the move- | i, 
ment is dynamic and keeps up ten- | T r U 
sion just as the Nazis and Fascists 
do. It has much the same ends, 
too, since it represents a perma-| 
nent revolution. | 
“The Falange has not so much a/| 
program as a point of view. It is | 
syndicalist, net socialist. Old 


forms of organization have been de- | fi rst tI me 


stroyed by the war, and we can| 
start afresh. 

“The Falange has members from 
all classes—peasants, workers and 
middie class—and includes many 
former Socialists and Communists. 
It is difficult for older people to 6 U 
change, but we count upon youth | y 
to supply the strength of the move-| 
ment. 
“The syndicalist State we pur- 
pose to establish will differ from | 
the corporative State of Italy, be- | 
cause the corporative State is the | 
organ of the political State, while} 
the syndicalist State will be the in- | 
strument of the political State. The | 
State will govern national economy 
through syndicates. When employer 
and worker come in conflict, the 
State will intervene and have the 
last word. 

Vertical Syndicates 


‘Moreover, in Italy workers and 
employers are in separate organiza- | 
tions, but here they will be in one 
vertical syndicate for each impor-| 
tant industry. Italian fascism took | 
over the existing trade unions and 
employers’ organizations and sought | 
to conciliate between them by the 
corporative State, but we can begin | 
anew without having to continue |

vealed many shortcomings in the} 
field of advertising, it can combine | 
with advertising to bring about 
“more intelligent consumer buy-

‘‘Manufacturers and retailers are | 
partners in industry,’’ he declared, 
“even while there may be. some

POPE PIUS AVOIDS 
MEETING HITLER 


-}sooner was it known, 


Pontiff Retires to Seclusion of 
Summer Home Just Before 
Rome Visit of Chancellor 


BRAVES INADEQUATE HEAT 


Deplores European Confusion, 
but Sees Hope in Renewed 
interest in Missions 


By ARNAWUDO CORTESI 

Wireless to Tat New Yorx Times 
VATICAN C!TY, April 30.—All 
hope that any advantage would be 
taken of Chancellor Adolf Hitler's 
visit to Rome to explore the possi- 
bilities of peace between the Nazi 


| pears to be determined to remain 


firm on its present positions and to 
meet the foreseen offensive with its 
usual policy of passive resistance. 


Preparations Made Early 


The Pope's departure before Hit- 
ler’s arrival is entirely in accord- 
ance with the original program. No 
in fact, that 
would be in Rome early in 
May than the Pope ordered his 
Summer residence to be got ready 
by April 30. There was some talk. 
however, that the Pontiff might 
change his plans when the absorp- 
tion of Austria by Germany put 
rather a different complexion on 
the fight between Nazism and Ca- 
tholicism and particularly when 
Theodor Cardinal Innitzer of Vi- 
enna, after a long conversation with 
Hitler was summoned to Rome by 
the Pope. 

The Vatican consistently denied 
all reports of possible meetings be- 
tween the Pope and Hitler but did 
so in a very half-hearted fashion, 
evidently loath to commit itself 
until the result was known of the 
contacts in Berlin and Vienna. Now 
all uncertainty has been eliminated 
by the departure of the Pope for 
Castel Gandolfo. 


Pleased With Missions Fund 
Before leaving, the Pope made it 
clear in an address to the Superior 
Council of the Board for the Propa- 


Hitler 


to be the beginning of a reign of 


peace, instead of which, behold, it 
has been the herald and forerunner 
of an inferno of confusion ‘and con- 
tradiction. 

“Our fathers have seen some 
forms of good that we no longer 
know but we see some forms of 
good that they never knew. For 
instance, this marvelous growth of 
missions and this reawakening of 
missionary conscience, this con- 
stant strengthening of Eucharistic 
devotion and the great promise of 
good held out by Catholic Action 
Associations, of which even in the 
past few days we have had con- 
soling confirmation from the mis 
sions in India and China ”’ 

The Pope ended by rging the 
Superior Council of the Board for 
the Propagation of the Faith to 
persevere in its efforts and im- 
parted to it the apostolic benedic- 
tion. 

The Pope left for Castel Gandolfo 
at 5:10 this afternoon, in strictly 
private forms He and the most inti- 
mate members of his personal 
household, including the papal 
physician, took seats in four closed 
automobiles. 

Cheered by Crowds 

The Pope, dressed all in black and 
therefore indistinguishable from an 
ordinary ecclesiastic, was neverthe- 
less recognized and cheered by a 


considerable crowd gathered in St

“a deep difference” still lies

“Our French friends still 
like us to guarantee some sort of 
Czech ascendancy in the mixed 
State,”’ the editor writes Britain 
should not be induced to guarantee 
anything whatever in that hopeless 
connection, for nothing that we at- 
tempted to support could stand in 
default of an agreement between 
the Czechs and the Sudeten Ger- 
mans themselves. For such an 
agreement the complete self-gov 
erning equality of the German ele- 
ment is now a requisite There 
should be no mistake about this ab- 
solute certainty 

“The Czechs and our French al- 
lies are not yet willing to face that 
complete equality, but it is the only 
way to peace British policy re

the Pope after driving about fif-

passed through the village of 
Albano, where the whole popula- 
tion waited in the principal square. 

The most imposing demonstration 
occurred, however, at Gandolfo it- 
self, where many thousands gath- 
ered outside the papal villa to re- 
ceive the Pontiff’s blessing. His ap- 
pearance on the central balcony was 
greeted with loud cheering and 
much waving of the Italian and 
papal flags, while the municipal 
band played the papai hymn, the 
Italian royal march and the Fascist 
marching song 

After giving his blessing the Pope 
acknowledged the cheers, that broke 
out afresh, with a friendly wave 
of his hand and then retired to his 
private chapel.

LEAGUE CONCESSION 
I$ ASKED BY SWISS 


Permanent Neutrality Within 
Covenant Is Proposed in 
Petition to Council 


SANCTIONS’ FAILURE CITED 


Debate Will Raise Question of 
Use of Alpine Tunnels by 
Germany and Italy 


Wireiess to THe New Yorx Times 

GENEVA, April 30.—The League 
of Nations published today the 
Swiss Government's memoranduni 
requesting from the May meeting 
of the Council a ‘“‘declaration that 
the traditional neutrality of the 
Confederation is consistent with the 
Covenant’s provisions.’’ 

The memorandum stresses the 
‘‘unique”’ character of Switzerland's 
position in the world and in the 
League and throughout makes its 
request as a special favor. This is 
to enable the Council to grant it 
without establishing a precedent 

upsetting the existing principle that 
neutrality is inconsistent with 
League membership. 

The memorandum gives the gen- 
eral Swiss case, touching only 
vaguely, when at ali, on the moot 
points in the practical diplomatic 
discussion of this question 

These points include the follow- 
ing: 

If Switzerland's request is granted 
it should be known whether or not 
Switzerland will agree: 

First, to make no objection to the | 
| League's deciding in its palace here 
lin Switzerland to apply the Cove- 
lnant sanctions against an aggres- 

sor and thus become an ‘“‘armed 
coalition,’’ which former President 
|Giusseppe Motta, a few months 
ago, said that Switzerland could 
rot permit to be formed on her 
neutral soil; 
| Second, to defend stoutly against | 
| Germany the path through Switzer- 
land to France and not plan to re- 
tire after a token of resistance from 
this relatively weak position to the 
Alps and leave France and Geneva 
uncovered; 
| Third, to close the Alpine tunnels | 
ito all belligerents—which means 
ithat the German-Italian axis could 
revolve through Switzerland 
these States have -special 
rights in the St. Gotthard 


not 
though 
treaty 
tunnel. 

Future Role Is Question 


There are also questions as to 
what Switzerland’s future role in 
the League would be and whether 
Switzerland expects her neutrality 
to be guaranteed as before the war 
and by what powers. The only 
light the memorandum throws on 
any of these big questions must be 
extracted from the following pas-| 
sage: 

“Switzerland trusts that’ the 
League of Nations, of which she is 
| proud of being the home, will over- 
|come its present difficulties. Al- 
though in accordance with her 
undertaking of Feb. 13, 1920, she 
has modernized and reorganized 
her army, for which her people 
|have, in fact, made the greatest | 
sacrifices, she remains faithful to| 
|the League and its ideal of peace | 
| and international cooperation. She 
| will continue to collaborate with the 
| League in all questions in which | 
| her status as a neutral is not in-| 
| volved, but she considers herself 
entitled to ask that her absolute 
neutrality be explicitly recognized 
| within the League framework.”’ 
The memorandum stresses that | 
| Switzerland has declared her neu- 
trality for four centuries, that for 
the Alpine passes to be ::eutral is 
}in the interests of all Europe and 
that only neutrality can preserve 
| the Swiss union of German, French 
|}and Italian cantons. It points out 
j}that this situation led the Council 
jon Feb. 13, 1920, to agree to exempt 
|Switzerland from military sanc- 
|tions provided that she defended 
|her territory against all invaders 
and accepted the covenant provi- 
sions for non-military sanctions. 
On this understanding Switzerland 
joined the League by a small pleb- 
|}iscite majority. 


Circumstances Have Changed 


The note then pleads for the ex- 
|emption from non-military sanc- 
|tions on the ground of the non- 
| realization of the hopes that led 
ithe Swiss to accept this departure 
| from neutrality. 
| ‘Circumstances have greatly 
|changed since Switzerland joined 
| the League,’’ the note says. ‘‘Some 
lof the most important covenant 
| clauses have not been enforced. 
|The sanctions system has not op- 
erated in every case. Competition

Germans Mast Report 
On All Foreign Credits 


By The Associated Press 

BERLIN, April 30.—The Fi- 
nance Ministry issued an order 
tonight that all foreign credits 
held by Germans or persons dom- 
iciled in Germany, not including 
Austria, must be reported to the 
Reichsbank by May 20. 

The credits must be reported as 
they stood today. 

They include bank accounts, se- 
eurities, loans, mortgages, insur- 
ances and proceeds of inher- 
itances. 

It expressly was stated the de- 
tails were needed merely for sta- 
tistical purposes and the order 
was not intended to involve pos- 
sible surrender of the credits. 

EE 





in armaments has been resumed on 
a larger scale than ever, 

“Instead of becoming universal 
the League has lost the participa- 
tion of some important countries. 
The United States did not see its 
way to join and four great coun- 
tries, two of which are Switzer- 
land’s neighbors, have withdrawn 

‘Such a state of affairs could not 
but affect the position of a per- 
petually neutral country. Owing to 
her unique situation Switzerland 
cannot accept the system of op- 
tional sanctions. Her neutrality can- 
not be allowed to depend upon cir- 


' cumstances. It has been established 


once and for all that its strength 
is in its clear, definitive and per- 
manent character. 


““At the present day, the distinc- 


'tion between military and economic 
|sanctions would prove 


illusory so 
far as Switzerland is concerned. If 
she resorted to economic pressure 
she would be in grave danger of 
being treated exactly as if she had 
taken military action.”’ 


3 RED ARMY CHIEFS 
SEEM IN DIFFICULTIES 


Their Names Are Missing From 
the May Day Orders 


MOSCOW, April 30 (P).—General 
P. E. Dybenko, one of the most 
romantic figures of the Bolshevik 
revolution, has been removed as 
commander of the strategically im- 
portant Leningrad military district. 

Reports of his removal, current 
since February, were confirmed to- 
day when an order in connection 
with the May Day parade was 
signean by his successor, General 
Khozin. 

Omission of his name from the 
list containing thousands of others 
cited for honors on the twentieth 
anniversary of the Red Army had 
led to rumors of his dismissal. 

General Dybenko is the former 
Mme. Alexandra Kol- 
lontay, Soviet Minister to Sweden, 
anc was one of the judges who 
passed the death sentence on MA&r- 
shal Mikhail N. Tukhachevsky and 
seven other higr Red Army leaders 
last June. 

In 1917 Generaf Dybenko led the 
Baltic fleet which trained guns on 
th. Winter palace at Petrograd, 
nov- Leningrad, greatly aiding the 
Bolsheviki in their revolution. 

The names of two other high of- 
ficers were omitted from orders in 
connection with the May Day 
parade. They were Marshal A. I. 


| Yegoroff, former vice commissar of 


defense, and Commander I. P. 
Beloff, stationed at Minsk in Soviet 
White Russia. Rumors of their re- 
moval had circulated since Febru- 
ary. They also were members of 


| the June court martial. 


HITLER SEEN TRYING 
FOR ADRIATIC PORT 


Continued From Page One 


throw under his feet the riches of 
the Ukraine. 

To reach that goal it would be 
necessary to pass over the smaller 
States that lie across the path of 
German expansion. Hitler wants 
Czechoslovakia as a vassal. Not, 
only the German districts but the 
whole republic, because that would 
open to him access .o Rumania, He 
also thinks he needs Hungary on 
the other side of the Danube, be- 
cause of its agricultural products 
and equally because control of 
Hungarian economic policy would 
permit practically’ complete en- 
circlement of Czechoslovakia. 

But Hungary is a client of Italy, 
even older than was Austria. The 
Italian port of Fiume exists through 
Hungarian maritime trade. 

The vassalage of Budapest to Ber- 
lin will not be absolute as long as/ 
Mussolini’s consent is not obtained. 
Therefore Hitler needs a formal 
agreement with regard to zones of 
influence. It really would exclude 
Italy from the Danube Valley alto- 
gether. In any case, Hitler refuses 
to recognize anything outside Yugo- 
slavia as belonging to Italy’s share. 

Third, the attitude of the powers 
in the Berlin-Rome axis must be 
decided toward an expected move 
by the British Government, fol- 
lowed by the French, in favor of 
the creation of a combination of 
the great powers of Europe on the 
lines of the unsuccessful Four- 
Power pact concluded at Mussolini’s 
initiative some years ago. 

Hitler opposed the idea altogether. 
He cannot avoid the true reason, 
which is his unwillingness to re- 
lease Italy from direct dependence 
on him in the Rome-Berlin axis. 
Instead, he puts forward the fol- 
lowing arguments: 

A four-power agreement exposes 
Germany and Italy to the danger 
of having to discuss later the in- 
clusion of Russia, which would be 
contrary to the principles of the 
anti-Comrunist pact between Ber- 
lin, Rome and Tokyo. Also Hitler 
holds the view that France is now 
reduced to the position of a second- 
class power, not deserving a place 
in the front rank next to Germany, 
Britain and Italy. 

The Nazi mentality is violently 
opposed to any combination that 
obliges Germany to compromise on 
her demands. Hitler sees in Brit- 
tain, with her wealth and colonial 
possessions, a destined victim of 
the virile Germans when their 80,- 
000,000 are united in Europe. He 
does not want to injure the pros- 
pects of a resplendent future by a 
compromise with decadent peoples. 

Mussolini, as is well known, 
thinks differently. His ambition is 
to return swiftly to close collabora- 
tion with London and Paris, which 
he never would have deserted had 
it not been for the unfortunate 
quarrel over Ethiopia. Also Musso- 
lini possesses more imagination 
than Hitler and visualizes easier 
the immense power of Britain, with 
her immense resources, which are 
only just beginning to be tapped. 
Fourth, German diplomacy would 
be delighted if it succeeds in sep- 
arating permanently Italy and 
France. It believes the Anglo-Ital- 
lan agreement will become para- 
lyzed if the French cannot come to 
terms with Mussolini. Hitler still 
hopes to persuade his Italian ally 
that the French regime is hope- 
lessly rotten and that the State is 
destined to end in disruption under 
the guidance of Marxist elements. 
Hitler would like Italian expan- 
sion to be directed toward French 
territories. He points out that the 
ancient possessions of the royal 
Italian house, namely Savoy, and

Reich’s Cruise Ships Held 


Special Cable to Toe New Yorke Truzs. 

LONDON, April 30.—Aerjal pho- 
tographs of Germany's $5,000,000 

“Strength Through Joy” cruise 
ship, the Wilhelm Gustloff, fore- 
runner of a fleet of twenty sim- 
ilar ships, have aroused consid- 
erable speculation here whether 
these craft with their long upper 
deck, obstructed only by a funnel, 
could quickly be converted into 
aircraft carriers. 

The Wilhelm Gustloff, of 25,000 
tons gross, is about 700 feet long 
and has a deck area of 53,800 
square feet, claimed to be larger 


than any vessels of this size. 
Reynolds Sunday News quotes a 
shipping expert as saying that 
this deck could easily be length- 
ened to form a flying deck and 
the vessel’s speed, now stated to 
be 15% knots, could be readily in- 
creased. 

Thus modified she could accom- 
modate thirty-five aircraft—half 
the number of machines allotted | 
to Britain’s new super-carrier, the 
Ark Royal, which is starting her 
trials next week. 


the Nice district naturally are des-| 
tined to fall to Italy’s share when | 
France is wrecked by social unrest. | 
Also the island of Corsica is needed | 
to complete the domination of the | 
Tyrrhenian Sea so that the latter 
can become an Italian lake. Tunis, | 
on the shore of Africa, nearly vis-| 
ible from Sicily, is a land predes-| 
tined for occupation by the Italian | 
race. } 

Thus the siren’s voice from | 
Berlin already sings the praises of 
Italian irredenta at the expense of 
France. 

Mussolini is too clever to accept 
this attractive dream as a reality. 
He prefers certainly real advan- 
tages, political and economic col-| ~ 
laboration with the Western powers 
to the duubtful prospect of mythical 
agerandizement. 

During Hitler’s visit to Rome 
therefore loud speeches will be 
heard but sensational action is ex- 
tremely unlikely. 

Germany's strategic position in 
Central Europe is so strong now 
that Hitler really does not have to 
revert to force to obtain all his de- 
sires. It is quite unnecessary for 
him to go to war against Czecho- 
slovakia when by constant eco- 
nomic pressure he can reach better 
results in a cheaper way. 

The fifth point that Hitler is 
eager to discuss with Il Duce is the 
tightening of military cooperation 
between their countries. 

Until now Rome has been linked 
to Berlin by a general promise that 
one partner in the axis should come 
to the assistance of the other in 
case of aggression by more than 
one great power. As a result, for 
example, during the quarrel over 
Ethiopia the position of Italy in

resisted pressure from Berlin in| 
that sense but the course, publicly 
proclaimed, of cooperation between 
the British and French general 
staffs now furnishes Hitler with a 
pretext for a return to the attack 
demanding an equivalent gesture. 

The view of London in such a case 
would be that the cooperation of 
the military circles in Rome and 
Berlin is sufficiently intimate now 
and that publicity would not change 
the real situation.

PRENCH TAKE STEPS 
ON SUDETEN ISSUE 


Envoys in Berlin and Prague to 
Act in Effort to Settle 
Minority Question 


PARIS PRESS ‘RESERVED’ 


Many Confused as to Whether 
the Agreement Reached Is 
a Defensive Alliance 


Wireless to THE New York Times. 

PARIS, April 30.—The first tangi- 
ble consequence of the London con- 
versations will be a joint Franco- 
British representation to Berlin and 
Prague in the interests of a peace- 
ful settlement of the Sudeten ques- 
tion. The Quai d’Orsay ordered its 
Ambassadors to take this step im- 
mediately and it is expecting the 
British to make ag identical move, 
but under the terms of the London 
accord itself the two governments 
reserve the right to make separate 
conditions as to how they will back 
their suggestions. 

One of the first weaknesses of 
the accord to be brought to light 1s 
that the two governments have 
agreed to make identical represen- 
tations but there the common ac- 
tion ceases and from that point on 
they are simply bound to keep each 
other informed and try to work to- 
gether for the good of peace. 

The French are inclined to make 
plain that their interest in the 
question is more than one of pla- 
tonic interest in peace in general. 
They are going to give reasons why 
France will not accede to a forceful 
solution of the Czech dispute. But 
they cannot be certain how strong 
will be the British effort to support 
them. 


Extent of Accord Unknown 


There is similar confusion in the 
minds of many here as to just how 
close the Franco-British under- 
standing comes to being a defensive 
military alliance for Western Eu- 
rope. It is contended in some circles 
that it is really a military alliance 
on land, sea and air that will be 
concluded after the visit to Paris 
of the British sovereigns Others 
contend that a defensive alliance of 
this type leaves the whole decision 
open to Britain at the moment 
something happens and that she is 
not bound to any definite action. 
This must be elucidated by staff 
talks. 

Premier Edouard Daladier today 
conferred with President Albert Le- 
brun, reporting fully on what trans- 
pired in London and Foreign Min- 
ister Georges Bonnet received Dr. 
Stefan Osusky, the Czech envoy, in- 
forming him of discussions that 
took place with regard to Czecho- 
lovakia. On Monday there will be 
two Cabinet meetings to discuss the 
esults obtained in London and to 
approve the first decree laws on fi- 
nancial reform that Finance Min- 
ister Paul Marchandeau has pre- 
pared. 

M. Daladier today presided at the 
opening of the newly cre- 
ited commission that was organized

WASHINGTON, April 30.—Bryan 
Untiedt, who was a national hero 
at 12 years and a guest of President 
Hoover at the White House, was in 
jail at 18 because of his inability to 
pay a $7 fine for driving a truck 
without a license. But now, at 19, 
Colorado boy whose bravery 
saved the lives of fifteen children 
trapped in a school bus in a bliz- 
zard, is again on the way upward, 
the National Youth Administration 
reported today. 

Bryan's problem as the sole sup- 
port of an incapacitated father and 
six younger sisters came to Presi- 
dent Roosevelt's attention last year 
when a Denver lawyer won an end 
of the jail sentence. The interven- 
tion of the Youth Administration 
followed. 

The boy had had a little experi- 
ence in construction work. He was 
placed on a Youth Administration 
project at Fountain, Col., and there 
had the friendly interest 
supervising engineer and the archi- 
tect. 

The further training enabled him 


voted for armaments would not be 
diverted to other governmental 
uses. General Edouard Nollet heads 
the committee and Abel Gardey was 
appointed vice president. 

The Paris press today greeted the 
London communiqué with some re- 
serve. The comment shows that on 
many points its text needs amplifi- 
cation. M. Daladier said: 

“T believe the accord reached and 
decisions taken will not fail to have 
good results. In short, it is @ good 
impression that I bring back from 
my visit to Britain.” 

Bonnet Compliments British 


M. Bonnet complimented Prime 
Minister Neville Chamberlain and 


Viscount Halifax, Foreign Minister, ; 


on their great understanding of the 
French viewpoint and said: 

“IT am delighted to see that the 
French and British press has been 
unanimous in concluding that the 
Franco-British accords mark a new 
stage toward the total solidarity of 
the two governments not only to 
defend their common interests but 
to support the great ideals that in- 
spire their two peoples.” 

The French press was not quite 
so unanimous in its approval, as 
M. Bonnet stated, but even 
Humanité, which has been violently 
attacking the negotiations, admitted 
that ‘‘military agreements are use- 


ful and can greatly serve the cause | 


of peace ; 

The Temps declares that it is evi- 
dent that ‘‘France and Britain are 
more completely than ever organiz- 
ing their political, diplomatic, mili- 
tary and economic cooperation.” 

Regarding Czechoslovakia the 
Temps adds: 

“Tf the course of action agreed 
upon in London can be carried out 
in a way to achieve solution of the 
question of the German minority in 
Czechoslovakia it will constitute an 
essential contribution to the pacifi- 
cation of Europe.” 

Nobody can tell yet what the re- 
sults of the London talks will be, 
says the Journal des Debats, but 
the important thing is to note that 
hereafter France and Britain can- 
not undertake anything alone with- 
out the consent and assistance of 
the other. 

“From the union of France and 
Britain great results may be ex- 
pected,"’ says the Journal des De- 
bats. “‘It igs to be hoped that this

to advance in this field, but needed 
a job and training.” 

In reviewing his experience the 
boy made no mention of his ex- 
ploit, Mr. Rowe added, but talked 
only about the jobs he had had, 
the training in carpentry his father 
had given him and his father’s 
favorite rule: 

“If you don’t do it right, don’t 


do it at all.” 


‘truth will never be lost sight of 
jeither in Paris or in London."’ 


It is notable that in the French 
press today there is not a single 
word to indicate that anything re- 
lating to finances was considered 
during the London conversations. 


BRAZIL’S PRESS PRINTS 
REICH ATTACK ON U.S. 


Dispatch Refers to Our Nation 
as ‘a Democracy of Noise’ 


Special Cable to Tus New Yorx Times, 

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, April 
30.—To upset what Nazis term ‘‘the 
expanding sphere of United States 
influence in Brazil’’ after the in- 
duction of Oswaldo Aranha as For- 
eign Minister, the press released 
this week an apparently inspired 
Berlin dispatch branding the Tnited 
States ‘‘a democracy of noise.’’ 

The press refers to American 
newspapers’ campaign against Bra- 
zil’s ‘‘supposed nazification,’’ which, 
it says, Latin America receives re- 
servedly. 

Quoting the Berlin Boersen Zei- 
tung, the dispatch comments on the 
great sums expended by the United 
States, which, according to the Bra- 
zilian newspaper man Mr. Chatau- 
briand, are ‘‘for pure idealism, to 
protect the American Continent 
against attacks by imperialistic na- 
tions.”’ 

The Boersen Zeitung is quoted as 
averring American 


cally that Germany became a great 


i 
buyer of Brazilian cotton, shunning 


the United States market. It is 


said to stress this as among motives | 


of the United States’ campaign 
against Nazis in Brazil, inspired by 


|‘‘Jewish Yankee telegraphic agen- 


cies and unscrupulous merchants 
eager to increase dollar earnings.’’ 

This is the first time German dia- 
tribes against the United States in 
Brazil have taken such _ direct 
form.

May Day Rallies Today 


HENLEIN CAUTIONS PARTY 


Enjoins Germans to Maintain 
Discipline——Benes Dispatches 
Holiday Message to Hitler 


PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia, April 
30 ().—Czechoslovakia took exten- 
sive precautions today to prevent 
possible disorders in tomorrow's 
celebrations of May Day. 

The government announced that 
an order forbidding political pa-| 
rades would be enforced strictly. | 

Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten Ger. 


|/man party, representing the coun- 


try’s minority of 3,500,000 Germans, 
issued an appeal to its members to 
maintain discipline. 

The government, troubled by Herr 
Henlein’s demands for a change in| 
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy, au- 
tonomy for the Germans within her 
borders and other concessions, 
meanwhile utilized the occasion for 
a friendly gesture toward Germany. 
President Eduard Benes _ tele- 
graphed special May Day wishes to 
Chancellor Adolf Hitler, saying: 

“On the occasion of the national 
holiday I beg to convey to Your 
Excellency my most sincere felici- 
tations.’’ 

In Prague all parties except the 
German agreed on a common cele- 
bration in Wenzel Square. The 
only speaker will be the Mayor of 
Prague. Party flags will be absent. 

In the Sudeten German section of 
the country, celebrations will be 
conducted by Herr Henlein’s party, 
but only open-air meetings will be 
permitted. Gatherings in some dis- 
tricts where there is hoof and 
mouth disease have been prohibited 
entirely. 

“Keep discipline; do not let your- 
selves be provoked,” is the Ger- 
mans’ slogan for tomorrow. 

Herr Henlein’s press bureau is- 
sued an appeal to his followers de- 
claring that there were indications 
that the party’s enemies and agents 
provacateurs were at work to at- 
tempt to incite disorders. 

The government announced it 
would permit German citizens liv- 
ing in Czechoslovakia to fly their 
swastika flags side by side with the 
Czechoslovak flag tomorrow.

and the Nazi demonstrations in the|

elections in that district were post- 
poned today. The Sudeten German 
party newspaper gives great prom- 
inence to the postponement, and 
the party appears to be preparing 
protests on the subject.

whose duties careful are defined 
but no doubt was felt that a way 
would be found around this diffi- 
culty. It is a problem which it is 
expected will be solved by the inter- 
governmental and national comn 
tees, in cooperation with the int 
ested governments 

The general attitude here on this 
point was shown when responsible 
officials said it was inconceivable 
that human beings leaving a plac« 
of stress and having to find refuge 
would be denied entrance into the 
United States or other countries be- 
cause of technical reasons such as 
were reported to have been referred

was asked why it was 
the King to abandon 
ntages of ostensible consti- 
onarchy if he could find 
pportunist subservient 
to carry out his wishes 
we touch upon the real is- 
the Rumanian crisis,’’ he 
replied It is a moral crisis. The 
personal dictatorship of King Carol, 
the parliamentary facade, 
have been accepted for a 
long period if the people had had 
the feeling that it was used for the 
good of the country 
“Unfortunately, almost from the 
the people got the im- 
ion that an irresponsible group 
individuals were the King’s se- 
cret advisers, and that the country’s 
interests were being sacrificed to 
them That impression can be 
traced back to the return to Ru- 
mania of the lady who had accom 
panied King Carol into exile, in 
pite of the King’s pledge to the 
Prime Minister, M. Maniu, that she 
would remain abroad. When Prin- 
cess Helen, the King's divorced wife 
and mother of the Crown Prince, 
had to leave the country, the feel- 
ing of moral embarrassment and 
humiliation of the Rumanian people 
grew 
“Resentful of criticism and at- 
tack, it was natural that the King 
should come to be on the defensive 
and should accept, in government 
positions politicians with easy 
rather than uncompromising and 
independent morals 
“The most important thing in a 
State, the selection of the public 
Servants, was done in the wrong 
way. Soon the relative seclusion in 
which the King’s lady friend had 
remained in the beginning became 
impossible. Most people were bid- 
ding for her favor 
Deals With State Under Fire 
“The fact that some very impor- 
tant industrialists, suppliers to the 
State, were in her intimate circle, 
strengthened the popular belief 
about the ‘camarilla.’ Thus, slowly, 
the people accepted the fact, diffi- 
cult to control, that not only his 
secret advisers but the King him- 
self were using the royal power for 
personal materia] advantage. 
“*‘The King’s ministers themselves 


SS 








were telling extraordinary stories in 
their private conversations, but 
found it more convenient not to 
give up their positions. I myself do 
not believe that the King shared in 
deals actually disadvantageous to 
the interests of the country. But 
the hard fact is that this was and 
is the popular belief 

‘In this moral crisis the authority 
of the Crown was rapidly vanishing

reckless governmental measures, 
the Iron Guard obtained 16 per cent 
of the votes, while the democratic 
National Peasant party, headed by 
M. Maniu, obtained 22 per cent, 
proving thus that it was the strong- 
est party in the country 

‘The campaign of the democratic 
parties, as well as of the pro-Nazi, 
anti-Semitic [ron Guard, had been 
directed against the ‘camarilla 
The presence of the King’s friend, 
herself a Jewess, and of wealthy 
Jews within that royal circle served 
as an alibi for the ever-increasing 
anti-Semitic propaganda, thus mak- 
ing the whole Jewish population 
victim of hatred aroused by a few. 

“This time King Carol had his 


a go negate 
ti + ee 


back to the wall. His deep-seated | 
contempt for public opinion and, 
for normal democratic methods had 
brought him to a position where he 
either had to yield, and to restore | 
a real, constitutional regime, or, 
still having the control of the army, 
to abandon the principle of consti- | 
tutional monarchy altogether, and 


to impose a dictatorship. 
“With the help of the Patriarch, | 


'former chief supporter of all the! 


pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic move- 
ments, he suppressed the Constitu- 
tion and granted a new one, on 
which, after two days, the Ru-| 
manian people had to vote, orally, 
in front of governmental employes 
and surrounded by troops, ‘Yes’ 

or else. | 

“The farcical character of this 
plebiscite is already admitted evéry- 
where. Its ‘unanimity’ was imme- 
diately followed by a general con- 
fiscation of all arms, which facts 
are, if rather contradictory, highly 
significant.’’ 

Pointing out that Crown Prince 
Michael, who, he said, is loved by 
the ‘‘deeply monarchic’’ Rumanian 
people, will come of age in two 
years, M. Davila said that only 
through his succession could the 
present dynasty regain its popu- 
larity.

HAS MUCH REICH MUNITION 


Japanese Pressure Is Futile— 
Russians Helping Chinese 
Are All Fliers

HANKOW, China, April 30.—Not 
everything is totalitarian in this 
totalitarian world after all. Here in 
China, behind the lines in Hankow, 
you have the perplexing and ex- 
hilarating spectacle of Germans and 
Russians fighting on the same side. 

Ten thousand miles away Hitler 
and Stalin, political and ideological 
enemies, are snapping at each 
other; here in Hankow, the heart 
of Chinese resistance against Japan, 
German advisers and Russian pilots 
—even though they don’t kiss in 
pu iblic—are cooperating. 
The German advisers are mostly 
retired officers of the old Reichs- 
weht who have been in China for 
sor vears as technical assistants 
to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. 
No one knows exactly how many 
are serving China; best estimates 
aav between forty and sixty. There 
are also some German non-military 
experts, such as engineers 

The military Germans, the most 
skilled type of professional officer, 
were originally imported by the 
feneralissimo as instructors. Their 
ret chief was Colonel Max Bauer, 
who died of smallpox and was in 
time succeeded by the late General 
Hans von Seeckt, former Chief of 
Staff of the Reichswehr. 


Their Present Leader 


At present their leader is General 
Alexander von Falkenhau- 
slim officer with thick- 
who looks like a 
professor and who is one of the 
most cool-headed strategists ever 
produced by the German high com- 
mand. Another prominent German 
officer is Captain Walther Stinnes, 
who is head of Chiang Kai-shek's 
bodyguard 

The German advisers have risen 
steeply in importance in the last 
few months. At first Chiang wanted 
to fight his war against Japan in 
his own way; he listened to the 
German, but sometimes overruled 
them. Every one in Hankow knows 
that the Germans wanted Chiang to 
andle the defense of Shanghai 
differently, and that they did not 
advise a back-to-the-wall stand in 
Nanking 

Chiang lost Nanking. The Ger- 
mans were proved. right Now 
listens to them more care- 
the formidable suc- 
cess of ‘‘Chinese”’ strategy in the 
ecent battles above Suchow, when 
crack Japanese troops were sur- 
rounded and almost annihilated— 
the first field defeat of Japanese 
nfantry in history

Army Will Help Prima 
Midway Island Defen 


By The Associated Press 

WASHINGTON, April 30.—Of- 
ficial orders disclosed today that 
the army had } taated cooperating 
With the navy in preparing a new 
air-defense outpost far out in the 
Pacific at Midway Island 

They directed Lieutenant Henry 
L. Hille Jr. of the Civil Engineers 
Corps to proceed there to assist 
Lieutenant. William H. Ely, who 
has already made aerial surveys 
for a harbor channel and seaplane 
base to cost upward of $2,000,000. 

The navy is preparing the ship 
Sirius at San Francisco to take 
constructors to Midway, probably 
in the next few weeks. 

After the base for commercial 
and military seaplanes and a 
channel for small surface vessels 
have been completed in about two 
years, similar work is contemplat- 
ed at Wake Island. 

Both bits of land are way sta- 
tions on the transpacific line of 
Pan American Airways. 
———$—————————— 


ened by a long and indecisive 
Chinese campaign. 

The Germans in Hankow, self- 
sufficient and abi sea live 
by themselves. They do not mix 
with foreigners much, or even with 
Chinese except on official business. 
Oddly enough, the building used by 
General von Falkenhausen as head- 
quarters is in the old Japanese 


| Concession. 


The Russian Contingent 
The Russian contingent in Han- 
kow, a group that keeps to itself 
even more aloofly than the Ger- 


mans, also lives in the Japanese 
Concession. Most of the Russians 
are billeted in the Japanese Club. 
Students of irony—and for that 
matter any one who remembers the 
antediluvian yesterday when Chiang 
was fighting the Communists— 
relish the big picture of the Gen- 
eralissimo in the main hall, flanked 
by portraits of Stalin and Lenin. 
The Russians and the Germans 
almost never meet. They may be 
fighting on the same side, and ulti- 
mately their orders come from the 
same source, but there is no frat- 
ernization, no social contact of any 
kind.’ Even the anti-Nazis among 
the Germans are wary of the Reds. 
There are about 120 Russians in 
Hankow and 200 more are coming 
soon. They are all pilots. They have 
very fast pursuit ships, also power- 
ful bombers, but so far they have 
not been as active as they presum- 
ably will be later. The raid on For- 
mosa in February was, however, 
carried out by Russian planes. 
Russians, like most Russians 
everywhere, are attended by an at- 
mosphere of melodrama and mys- 


tery. They stick to their ships, they | 


obey orders, they keep their mouths 
shut, they avoid the Chinese and 
foreigners alike One day I met 
four of them, all survivors of a re- 
cent dog-fight. One had a broken 
spine, one terrible burns on the face 
and hands. 


Gave Up Soviet Nationality 


The Russians gave up their Soviet 
nationality on taking service in 
China. Of course, when they return 
to Moscow, one assumes that they 
will get their passports back. They 
get good pay in China. But they 
deserve it. They are a vital factor. 
Some Chinese, however, think 
they are a luxury, because of the 
special privileges they have de- 
manded. One story is that they lost 
a good many planes because their 
ships were too fast for the primitive 
Chinese landing grounds; they 
crashed on delivery Of course, 
Chinese landing grounds are a story 
in themselves—the only air fields in 
the world that are peripatetic. The 
Chinese move them from open space 
to open space overnight. 

The Russian Government, how- 
ever, has done something to soft- 
pedal Russian assistance to China. 
Its policy has been similar to its 
policy in Spain to render some 
help, but not too much 

Hankow gossip has it that Soviet 
Ambassador Dimitry V. Bogomoloff 
and his military attaché were re- 
called to Moscow because Mr. Bo- 
gomoloff gave the Chinese too 
much encouragement. When the 
Chinese politician Sun Fo, son of 
Dr. Sun Yat Sen and head of the 
Legislative Yuan, went to Moscow 
on his recent European trip, he got 
a rather cool reception. 

The squadron of fiiers known as 
the ‘‘International Squadron,”’ a 
group mostly of French and Ameri- 
can volunteers, has been demo- 
bilized. It was shot to pieces in re- 
cent fighting; only seven pilots, I 
was told, survived. Generalissimo 
Chiang’s two personal pilots, Roy 
Leonard and Julius Barr, are, how- 
ever, American; both are marvelous 
fliers and indispensable.

The exact location of the tempo- 
rary quarters in which the depart- 
ment was housed during its first 
three years has not been ascer- 
tained. In 1801 it was moved into 
the ‘Old War Office,’’ which was 


near the White House on the spot | 


now occupied by the southern end 
of the State Department Building. 

In 1879 the east wing of the new 
State, War and Navy Building was 
turned over to the navy, 
greater part of the department re- 
mained until the World War. In 
August, 1918, it moved into its pres- 
ent location on Constitution Avenue,

Mexican officials refused to com- 
ment today on reports that the 


Mexican Government is negotiating | 


for the sale of oil to Brazil. Gus- 
tavo Espinosa Mireles, director of 
government oil exports, when ques- 
tioned today said: ‘‘I can’t discuss 
the matter.” Asked if reports from 
Brazil were true that Mexican of- 
ficials had approached the Brazil- 
ian Government several weeks ago 
in an effort to sell oil, he declared: 
“That is possible.’’

Japanese Admit Clash Near 
Peining—Supplies From 
Tsingtao Threatened 


SHANGHAI, Sunday, May 1 (4).— 
A battle for possession of Tancheng, 
in Southern Shantung, twenty miles 
north of the Lung-Hai railway, to- 
day threatened supply lines of a 
Japanese advance guard that was 
reported only five miles from the 
railway 

Tancheng was captured by the 
Chinese in a surprise attack last 
night, but was quickly recaptured 
by a reinforced Japanese assault. 
Chinese headquarters admitted the 
oss, Dut said reinforcements were 
being rushed in for another attempt 
to take the city. Matowcheng, a vil- 
lage northwest of Tancheng, is ex- 
pected to be the scene of a major 
engagement 

Foreign military 


observers fre- 


quently have predicted the Chinese | 


would attempt to break the new 
Japanese offensive by drawing their 
columns quickly into the interior 
and then striking at the enemy sup- 


ply lines. This is the strategy they 


used in halting the previous Japa- | 


nese drive in South Shantung early 
in April. 

The Chinese drive on Tancheng 
particularly endangers the Japanese 
forces at Nanlakow, fifteen miles 
southwest of that town and five 
miles north of the Lung-Hai Rail- 
way, which is the objective of the 
invading army. Other Japanese 
forces are around Pihsien, about 
twenty miles southwest of Tan- 
cheng. 

It is here at the eastern end of 
the front that the Japanese have 
made their greatest threat. Despite 

incessant pounding in the 
Taierhchwang sector of the west, 
the invaders have been unable to 
break through the Chinese defenses 
in fifteen days of fighting 

The Chinese are entrenched 
strongly along the Grand Canal 
from the Tientsin-Pukow railway 

» Taierhchwang, cutting off any 
direct advance from the north on 
Suchow, junction of the Tientsin- 
Pukow and Lung-Hai railways. 

Reports from Canton said two of 
China's outstanding military lead- 
ers, in retirement since 1936 be- 
cause of revolts against 
ernment, had been named members 
of the National Defense Council. 
These leaders were General Chang 
Hsueh-liang, who seized General- 
issimo Chiang Kai-shek at Sian in 
1936, and General Cheng Chi-teng, 
who led the Kwangsi rebellion 
against the government. Both were 
strongly anti-Japanese before 
invasion, and it was largely

WHERE CHINESE ARE BLOCKING JAPANESE DRIVE ‘Strangling Parasitic Growth’ 


The fighting in Southern Shantung has centered at Matow- |

their effort to regain Tancheng to the southeast.

the government’s failure to take a 
firm stand against Japan that they 
revolted. 

In Shanghai Japanese authorities 
barred all Chinese from Hungijao, a 
foreign residence section. They said 
this was necessary for patrolling 


| that area. Chinese snipers were re- 


ported active nightly against Japa- 
nese garrisons within three miles of 
Shanghai. 


Chinese Attack Near Peiping 
PEIPING, April 30 (Delayed) (3. 
Chinese gendarmes returning to 

Peiping from the south today re- 
ported that Chinese guerrillas had 
dynamited the quarter-mile Peiping- 
Hankow railway pridge over the 
Liuli River thirty miles south of 
Peiping. The railway is the only 
direct link between Peiping and 
Japanese forces in Southern Hopeh 
Province. 

Demolition of the bridge was said 
to have coincided with a Chinese 
attack on Chochow, forty miles 
south of Peiping. The Chinese es-

Chochow was said to have contin-

shifted to the east today, with Japa- 
nese aided by aircraft. 

Five truckloads of Japanese 
troops were sent south from Pei- 
ping, and three truckloads of Japa- 
nese wounded arrived here last 
night 

A Japanese Army spokesman said 
that Chinese troops yesterday were 
threatening railways both south 
and east of Peiping. 

He stated that Chinese attacked 
the Peiping-Tientsin Railway yes- 
terday and that a day-long battle 
resulted. The attack was forty 
miles east of Peiping, near Lang- 
fang 

Japanese reinforcements were 
sent to the sector, the spokesman 
said 

The assault on Chochow, to the 
south, was by uniformed Chinese 


troops and was accompanied by an! 


uprising of plainclothes soldiers 
within the walis of the city. Street 
fighting continued throughout the 
night, but Japanese said their forces 
retained possession of the railway 
station.

had been occupied by Japanese, but 
he was unable to tell Prime Minis-

Spratly appears as only a speck

START MADE IN CORONA, 
Twelve Divisions Mobilized, 
but Only Four Make Full 
Trip to Fair Site 


An incessant downpour from’ 
leaden skies cut short yesterday the 
most elaborate parade ever planned | 


| in Queens County. Close to 100,000| York’s World’s Fair was announced | 


had mobilized in the’! 
Corona section to participate in the 
borough demonstration at the| 
World’s Fair preview in the Flush- | 
ing Meadows. But only 25,000 filed | 


| past the reviewing stand on the fair | 


grounds. 

Yesterday’s celebration was dedi-| 
| cated to the ‘‘World of Tomorrow’’; | 
its function, as announced by fair | 
officials, was to focus world and) 
nation-wide attention on the exposi- 
tion. But the residents of Queens 
regarded it as strictly a borough 
celebration. 

The Queens procession, which, to- 
|gether with a gust of wind from 
| the west, followed the motorcade 
into the fair grounds at 3:30 P. M., 





| was led by a mounted police escort, 
|a car in which were seated the 
| parade officials and a battery of 
|tanks from Miller Field, Staten Is- 
| land. Seated on top of the first 
| tank was Borough President George 
1U. arvey, wearing an American 
Legion overseas hat and the uni- 
‘form of a lieutenant colonel in the 

infantry reserves. | 

In the car were Louis C. Gos- 

|dorfer, general chairman of the 

parade; Colonel Alexander E. An- | 

| 

York National Guard, grand mar-| 

| 

| 


shal; Colonel John J. Mangan, 
Forty-fourth Division, National 
Guard, chief of staff; Captain Jonas |

THE NEW YORK 


The World's Fair preview celebra- 
yesterday gave operators of 
the city’s transportation facilities a 
foretaste of the extra burdens they 
must care for when the fair opens 
a year from now. Cancellation of 
the evening program because of in- 
clement weather eased a test that 
was expected, but the railroad, sub- 
way and bus lines expect to operate 
at full capacity today. 

The Interborough and B. M. T. 
lines serving the Queens territory 
vicinity of the fair grounds 
carried capacity loads yesterday 
morning, and lines carrying 
visitors from subway stations to the 
fair grounds and the new highways 
were taxed to their utmost. The 
Bronx and West Side lines of the 
Interborough recorded an unusually 
Saturday traffic because of 
crowds bound for midtown Manhat- 
tan to watch the parade. 

The city’s Independent Subway 
System carried an unusually heavy

A movement was begun among

in many cases, are continuing their 

work under the most difficult cir-

The plan is in the tentative stage, 
but at least two groups have an- 
nounced their intention of Savtieeest 
ing it. Gerhart H. Seger, editor 
of the Neue Volkzeitung, a Ger- 
weekly published 
here, has formed a_ preparatory 
committee, whose members include 
Dr. Edward Heimann of the New 
School of Social Research, Dr. 
Paul Tillich of the Union Theo- 
logical Seminary and Professor 
Felix Robert Mendelsohn of the 
musical division of New York Uni- 
versity. 

The American Guild for Cultural 
Freedom also has undertaken to act 
in a sponsoring capacity, according 
to Mrs. Sarah F. Brandes, execu- 
tive secretary of the organization 
She said members of the executive 
committee are giving the matter 
consideration, but details as to fi- 
nancing have not yet been worked 
out. 

“Such an exhibit would be of the 
utmost significance in its cultural 
and humanitarian implications,’’ 
she said. ‘It must not be allowed 
to remain a proposal; it must be 
translated into an actuality.”

Letters to Roosevelt 


MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 30 (»).— 
Keith H. Rupp, 29-year-old resident 
of Bakersfield, Calif., was ordered 
held in default of $25,000 bond to- 
day on a charge of threatening the 
life of President Roosevelt. 

United States Commissioner 


Featherstone ordered Rapp’s imme- | 


diate removal to California for 
trial. 

The salesman denied at the hear- 
ing that he had threatened to kill 
the President but testified that he 
“resisted a very faint impulse to 
kill him.” 

Secret Service operatives said that 
Rapp sent six threatening letters to 
the President from Bakersfield and 
that he was on his way to Wash- 
ington to see Mr. Roosevelt when 
he was removed from a bus at 
Memphis Monday. 

Rapp said that he wrote the Pres- 
ident but did not threaten his life, 
and added: 

“If I had an impulse to shoot the 
President! when he was in Cali- 
fornia it was a very faint one.”’ 

John T. Mullen, in charge of Se- 
cret Service men here, said Rapp 
was in a mental institution in Cali- 
fornia from 1935 to 1937.

who was followed in prayer by the 
Rev. Dr. Herbert S. Goldstein, rab- | 
bi of the synagogue. 

The reading of the Torah or scroll, 
which followed the morning prayer, 
a duty usually relegated to the pa-| 
triarchs of the congregation, was 
done by a delegation of fifteen 
young men. To make the youthful 
exercises complete, 13-year-old Rich- 
ard Baron of 350 Central Park 
West celebrated his Bar Mitzvah or | 
the Hebrew equivalent of induction 
into man's estate, by reading a part 
of the laws, before the Ark. | 

After an address by Lester Udell, 
president of the congregation, who 
thanked Dr. Goldstein for his ef- 
forts in obtaining the building, Mel- 
vin Friedman, 20, took over the 
ecantor’s duties and finished the 
service. 


Sermon by Rabbi’s Son 


Gabriel F, Goldstein, 20, a gradu- 
ate student in chemistry at Colum- 
bia and a son of Rabbi Goldstein, 
substituted for his father and de- 
livered the sermon. Declaring that 
the accent of American life seemed 
to be on a ‘“‘selfish, single-purposed 
race to make money,’’ he stressed 
the need for a ‘‘greater education.”’ 


W. Gerard, president of the club, 
presided, and presented a gold knife 
and chain to Maurice B. Blumen- 
thal, who substituted as leader of 
the district while Mr. Mahoney was 
a candidate for Mayor, and a brief 
case to United States District Judge 
John C, Knox.

There was only one 
in the waiting room 
and the intruder waited until he 
had left. Then he went to the 
ticket window and asked for a time- 
table.’ The agent, Dominick Girf- 
fredo of 362 Jackson Street, Orange, 
turned to reach for one and as he 
did so the thief produced a pistol 
taken and said: ‘‘Hand it all over; this 
Sena- is a stick-up.’

PARKWAY PLAN PUSHED 
Westchester Body Urges Sprain 
Brook Project at Meeting 


Special to THe New Yore TIMES 

WHITE PLAINS, N. Y., April 30 
—The Westchester County Park 
Commission urged the, County 
Board of Supervisors at joint 
session today to approve 4 proposal 
that the State be asked to build and 
assume control of a Sprain Brook 
Highway, to link the Bronx River 
Parkway Extension at Hawthorne 
and the Bronx River, Cross County 
and Saw MiJl River Parkways in 
Southern Westchester. 

No action was taken by the board, 
but it was understood a resolution 
would be presented on Monday. 
The State Council of Parks 
meet next month 

Chairman William J 
the commission said the parkway, 
which would cost about $7,000,000, 
would be constructed on a right of 
way already owned by the county 
and would form a link of the ar- 
terial express highway which Com- 
missioner Robert Moses of the 
State Council seeks to complete be- 
tween Albany and New York.

Y outhful Cadets ‘Capture’ Four Machine-Gun 
Emplacements on Governors Island—Hold 


Review and Are Guests at Luncheon 


Six companies of the Knicker- 


| bocker Greys, boys’ cadet regiment, 


marched yesterday in review on 
Governors Island, lunched in the 
messrooms of the Sixteenth Infan- 
try quartered there, and later cap- 
tured four machine-gun emplace- 
ments in a sham battle fought on 


| the open terrain of the polo field. 


The day’s manoeuvres were 
watched with enthusiasm by the 
island's junior civilian population 
and the practiced eyes of army- 
bred children were on the Greys as 
they went through precise drills on 
the temporary parade ground. 

More than 120 of the gray-garbed, 
rifle-carrying cadets passed in for- 
mation before three reviewing of- 
ficers during the hour-long parade 
of the morning. The Sixteenth In- 
fantry band, whose drum and bugle 
corps had met the cadets when they 
debarked from the 10:30 o'clock 
ferry from the Battery, marched 
with the cadet unit. 

The reviewing officers were Lieut. 
Col. John R. Mendenhall, 
manding officer of the Third Bat- 
talion, Sixteenth Infantry, and for- 
mer regular army instructor for six 
years with the Seventh Regiment; 
Lieutenant William H. Warrick, 
Seventh Regiment, N. Y. N. G., 
commandant of the Greys, and 
Cadet Commandant Peter Dineen. 

During the first half of the pa- 
rade Cadet Commandant Dineen 
put the Greys through their paces. 
Owing to his promotion from a 
cadet colonelcy on Friday at the an- 
nual Spring review, he then turned 


command of the regiment over to| 
| Cadet Colonel David Chavchavadze, 
'and took his position with the two 


reviewing officers as assistant to 


| Lieutenant Warrick. 


A minor mishap occurred while 
the cadets waited at parade rest 
before the review. A boy in A 
Company fainted. He was carried 


to a shady patch beneath the polo!

| The adjutant for the day was 
Cadet Major Roderick F. Read. His 
battalion commanders were Cadet 
Captain John Morris and Cadet 
Major William A. Armstrong. 
Others of the regimental staff were 


Cadet Captain J. Donald Greene 
and James .T. Van Norden. 


Following the review, the regi- 
ment stacked guns and went on an 
instruction tour. They saw the 
army stables and a horse-shoeing 


review on 


| demonstration, then returned to the 


barracks of the Sixteenth Infantry. 
Companies I, K and L showed 
them regulation equipment and 
then were hosts at lunch. 

The crowning event of the day— 
the attack upon four blazing ma- 
chine guns, was set for 2 o'clock. 
The guns, set up near the south 
end of the Polo Field, were manned 
by a detail of eight members of 
Company M, Seventh Regiment, 
under Lieutenant P. J. Hickey. 

The Greys assembled several hun- 


|dred yards away at the opposite 


end of the field. Advancing by ‘‘in- 
filtration,’’ two companies at a 
time, the cadets ran forward a few 
paces, fell flat, arose and continued 
toward the spitting machine guns. 
With care for realism, ‘‘dead’’ 
| Greys were left strewn along the 
line of advance, causing much 
*‘cluck-clucking”’ in the stands. 


A complete victory by the Greys, | 


who lost about 10 per cent of their 
men, silenced the guns and com- 
pany guidons were planted trium- 
phantly. 

And then it was time to go home, 
| back to the Seventh Regiment Ar- 
mory. Re-forming in marching or- 
der behind the Sixteenth Infantry 
| Band, the cadets started for the 

ferry slip. 





SOUTH AFRICA CALLS 
NATIVE SONS HOME 


One, on Relief in Canada, Gets 
Fare and Assured Job 


CALGARY, Alberta, April 30 (Ca- 
nadian Press).—Because South Afri- 
ca is calling back her native sons, 
S. H. de Montille, with his wife and 
three small children, is returning 
to the land of his birth. An engi- 
neer, Mr. de Montille has been on 
relief here for two years. 

Under a native-sons repatriation 
scheme, the South African Govern- 
ment has advanced $800 for his re- 
turn ° 

“It's a fine thing to have been 
born in South Africa,’’ he said. “I 
don’t imagine any other govern- 
ment would do as much for its na- 
tive sons. I am to receive Steady 
employment with the South African 
Railways on my arrival] home.” 

When he is re-established at Dur- 
ban, where he was born, Mr. de 
Montille will reimburse the govern- 
ment for the funds advanced.

While World's Fair enthusiasts

annual Boys Fair of the Madison

| True to the traditions of political 
rule books, a pair of ‘‘politicians,’ 
‘attracted by the crowd of mothers 
and children, appeared to make an 
appeal for votes. This, however, 
was quite in order, for the ‘‘poli-

|is a feature of the fair that a boy 
director shall rule the club for one 
| day of the celebration, and the suc- 


|eessful candidate at an election on 


| Thursday will reign next Friday. 

Johnny, in a brief speech, re- 
vealed that he was a New Dealer. 
He promised the voters two swim- 
ming pools if he elected, 
Buddy, more _ conservative, de- 
nounced his opponent for making 
such promises—‘‘you can’t build 
two swimming pools in twenty-four 
hours,’’ he declared—but promised 
a free movie on Friday if the voters 
favored him.

It was reported that for 1938, up

number of deaths in eighty-six 
large cities was 18,384 less than 
during the corresponding period of 
1937. In New York City, up to

Among the policy holders, diseases 
for which favorable mortality was 
recorded for the first quarter of

Without benefit of a single yacht-

Department Spring regatta. When 
the last hull had been wiped dry 
and the final sail lashed down 
twenty-four youthful sailors were 
in possession of gold, silver and 
bronze“medals to prove their sailing 
ability. 

Normally the list of entrants is 
twice as long as yesterday’s, Abra- 
ham L. Rosenberg, Department of 
Parks official who supervised the 
| Sailings, said, but the World’s Fair 
preview parade probably cut deep 
into the ranks of New York’s fu- 
ture America’s Cup defenders. 


It was the general opinion of the 
young skippers that it was not an 
ideal day for sailing. Some said 
the wind was too light, while others 
complained that it was too strong. 
A check of these opinions disclosed, 
however, that those complaining of

expressed greetings | 


An embryo paleontologist and a 
budding taxidermist were 
|yesterday as New York 
healthiest boy and girl after several 
months of preliminary examina- 
tions conducted by the Child Wel- 
|fare League of America, 130 East 

Twenty-second Street. The distinc- 
tions went to Sidney (Buddy) Pin- 
cus Jr., 13, of 720 West 173d Street, 
and to 12-year-old Stella Falkner of 
525 West 124th Street. 

The annual recognition of Child 
| Health Day had its culmination yes- 
terday at the Spear Auditorium, 22 
West Thirty-fourth Street, where 
more than 200 children from vari- 
ous settlement houses and recre- 
ation centers gathered to see the 
winners receive silver loving cups, 
|}emblematic of their health suprem- 
| acy, from Ernest H. Cole, extension 
| secretary of the league. 

Buddy, who weighs 108 pounds, 
has brown wavy hair and stands 
|5 feet 4 inches tall, explained yes- 
terday that although he enjoyed 
being healthy, he was not conscious 
|of striving too hard to attain that 
state. 
| “I drink a lot of milk—sometimes 
|more than a quart a day—and also 
plenty of fruit,’’ he said. Queried 
jon his taste for spinach, he was 
|forthright in his answer. “I eat 
}all vegetables, that is, almost all 
vegetables except lima beans—boy, 
are they terrible!’’ he added, 
crinkling his nose. 

As for athletics, he said, ‘I really 
don’t like baseball too much, but 
I do play a lot of football during 
the Winter, when a fellow doesn’t 
perspire.’” An eighth-grade pupil 
at Public School 118, Buddy is a 
devotee of outdoor life, however, 
and has been active in the Boy 
|Scouts, being a Star Scout in 
| Troop 755. His scouting brings him 
in close contact with nature and 
| there is nothing he loves more than 
to “skin snakes and stuff ’em.”’ 
He plans to continue in that field 
later on. 

Stella, who is only 55 inches tall 
and weighs 71 pounds, is in the 
eighth grade of Manhattanville 
Junior High School. She, too, has 
no predilection for fancy foods but 
likes whatever is put before her 
eggs, milk and even cereals. This 
is really her third prize for health. 
“Tl won two prizes in baby parades 
in Ridgefield Park, N. J., when I 
was 3 and 4 years old,’ she ex- 
plained. 

She startled questioners when she 
declared that she would like to be 
a paleontologist when she grows up. 
Without mispronouncing the word, 
she said: ‘‘I’d like to be a paleon- 
tologist because I suppose in 
my blood. My sister | Etta, a senior 
at Hunter College! is majoring in 
science and she likes it, and I've 
read some of the books she has, 
|I think that’s what I'm going to 
| be.” 
| Her other hobby, she added, was 
|reading—‘‘boys’ books, especially, 
|because most books for or about 
| girls are too sissyish and simpish, 
| if you don’t mind my saying so.”

Merchants’ Proposal Opposed 


The Merchants Association has al- 
ready written to the delegates sug- 
gesting an amendment for 
emption of $350,000,000 
bonds for unification, with a clause 
stating that the bonds are to 
exempt only so long ms they 
self-supporting. This proposal has 
met little favor with Mr. Unter- 
myer, because of the fact that 
might pave the way for a higher 
fare.

the ex

any time the lines fail

coating is

chloride, or a gelatine 
thereof 

To form the photograph on the 
aluminum plate the negative is 
placed over it and sunlight per- 
mitted to pass through. The changes 
in light produced by the negative 
produce corresponding photo-chem- 
ical changes in the silver salt im- 
tedded in the aluminum oxide coat- 
ing. The photo-chemical changes 
are revealed as a photograph. 

So tight is the bond between this, 
photograph and the aluminum plate 
that it does peel or crack off,

Although the course was 
ured and well marked not 
of the prize seekers refused to sail 
along so rigid a track. Some would 
beat to windward and then heel 
over and describe a circle that 
would carry them far from the pay- 
off mark. Others, not many, to be 
sure, would heel over and finally 
wind up in the water and on their 
sides. The free running manoeuvres 
of others left little to be desired, 
but when tacking was necessary 
they could not quite hold the 
course 

The 


meas- 
a few 


winner was Leo 
old, -1,289 Union 
Street, Brooklyn. Wenks entry, 
made by his father, Carl Wenk, a 
blacksmith, was in Class E, the 
largest boats, and managed to fin- 
ish in third place. Edwin Zank, 14, 
1,745 East Twenty-third Street, 
Brooklyn, won two prizes in Classes 
C and E, while Walter Seifert, 13, 
of 240 East Ejighty-third Street, 
Manhattan, took first prize in Class 
G, the power boats, and third prize 
in Class A. 

Ann Martin, 12, 995 Madison Ave- 
nue, the only girl to win a prize, 
took second place in Class E. One 
other girl was entered in the com- 
petition, but she lost out. 

The craft ranged from a repro- 
duction of a man-of-war that dates 
back to about the War of 1812 to a 
pudgy craft, whose owner admitted 
it was first intended as a power 
boat. There were sloops, schooners, 
skipjacks and even a model the 
owner referred to as a “sort of 
modified clipper.’’ Many of them 
were products of the home work- 
shop whose skippers admitted ‘‘Dad 
did most of the work.”’ 

No untoward event marred the 
contests, though it seemed that the 
wind blew too strong when the light 
boats were competing and disap- 
peared altogether when the heavier 
craft went to the starting line. 

Group honors for the day were 
captured by several boys from 
James Madison High School in 
Brooklyn, who, apparently on the 
spur of the moment, decided the 
“Viking Yacht Club’ would be a 
good name for their organization 
Four boys, Edwin Zank, Bertram 
Malenka, 1,610 Avenue P, Brook- 
lyn; William Fischler, 2,241 Ocean 
Avenue, Brooklyn; and Edwin 
Levy, 1,465 East Twenty-first 
Street, Brooklyn, made up the 
group and they managed to carry 
off first, second and third prizes 
in Classes C and F.

lows:

More than 400 organizations used | 


the placement and information serv- 
ices of the Children’s Welfare Fed- 
eration last year, Dr. Shirley 
Wynne, president, reported at the 
federation’s annual meeting last 
week. 

Dr. Wynne also reported that it 
had answered 7,065 inquiries and 


had assisted in placing 5,260 chil- | 
temporary | 


dren in hospitals or 
shelters. Donors to the Mothers’ 
Milk Bureau conducted by the fed- 
eration, he added, had doubled since 
the last annual report. 


Plans for a building to be known | 
as the Children’s World, which will | 


be erected at the 1939 World’s Fair, 


were described by Miss Henrietta | 


Additon, director of housing and 
welfare for the Fair. Homer Folks,

said that it resembled the horn on 
early phonographs. 

The bugle operates on very short 
radio waves which are generated in 
the small end and can be directed 
through it to any given point just as 
a searchlight is directed. A radio 
receiver not in the direct path of 
the narrow beam cannot pick up 
the messages. 

The bugle would have many ad- 
vantages during a war in directing 
messages between ships or be- 
| tween army organizations operating 
jon land without fear of their being 
received by an enemy, Dr. Barrow 
saic It can also be used for the 
transmission of private comunica- 
tions. 

Its greatest immediate value, he 
added, would probably be its use 
as a direction-finder for airplanes 
or ships -

PROVIDENCE, April 30.—Brown 
University will dedicate its new $10.,- 
000 boat club at the head of Narra- 
gansett Bay Saturday as a feature 
of the Intercollegiate Dinghy Rac- 
ing Association regatta sponsored 
by the Brown Yacht Club. Sixteen 
boats from eight colleges and uni- 
versities are expected to compete. 

The regatta, to be followed by a 
tea dance in the main lounge of the 
new building, is a part of the uni- 
versity’s annual Junior Week-End. 
Other events scheduled include the 
Spring Day program on the Middle 
Campus, the Brown and Pembroke 
musical revue, 
la’’ and the junior 
Friday night. Many fraternities are 
arranging house parties 

Dedication ceremonies at the club- 
house will mark the ninetieth anni- 
versary of the first undergraduate 
boat club at Brown, according to 
Professor Zenas R. Bliss, faculty 
adviser for the Brown Yacht Club 
and twice navigator for Harold S. 
Vanderbilt’s winning defenders of 
the America’s Cup, Rainbow and 
Ranger. The first student boat 
club was formed in the Spring of 
1848, he said, after twelve under- 
graduates bought a sailboat to 
at Bristol, R. 1 

The university expects that the 
new clubhouse will prove an added 
impetus to undergraduates sailing. 
Four years ago the yacht club had 
only half a dozen students manning 
their own and borrowed boats. To- 
day the club has nearly seventy-five 
members, official university recog- 
nition, its own dinghies and a com- 
plete schedule of intramural and in- 
tercollegiate races

Students Develop Technique in New Club |... coucuer stupents 


Special to Tae New YoRK TIMES. 


SWARTHMORE, Pa., April 30.— 
A desire to develop technique and 
composition in the modern dance 
has inspired fifteen women students 
at Swarthmore College to organize 
a dance club under the direction of 
Miss Alice Gates of the Women's 
Athletic Department. Symposiums 
have already been given with Tem- 
ple and the University of Pen insy! 
vania. A recital was prepared for 
the art clubs of the Lower Merion 
High School, and informal exhibi- 
tions have been given here. 

Swarthmore, Temple and the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania are the only 
schools in this area which have 
added the modern dance to the reg- 
ular athletic program, but plans are 
being made, according to Miss 
Gates. to establish classes at Bryn 
Mawr next yea! 

The Swarthmore group 
aged by Miss Gates, who joined the 


encour- 


athletic department this year, start- 
ed with those who *ad indicated 
their interest in forming such a 
club. Because of the increased in 
terest on the part of Swarthmore 
women in modern dancing, tryouts 
will bé held this Spring for those 
who wish to take part in the club 
next year 

The most important aborate 
work of the dance club year 
will be the part played in the an- 
nual Swarthmore May Day next 
Saturday. The American Suite, con- 
sisting of a work song, study in jazz 
rhythms and the square dance, 
which has been given several times 
this year, will be the basis of the 
May Day dance, which will be of 
similar technique and spirit. ‘“The 
Lumberjacks’’ is the title 

The final activity of the club this 
year will be an open meeting and 
social party.

MIDDLEBURY SHIFTS FETE 


| Growth Foress Conumunecenanit! 
From Church to Campus 


Specia] to THe New YorK Trues 
MIDDLEBURY, Vt., April 30.— 
Increased enrollment at Middlebury 


wil: necessitate the breaking of a 
century-old tradition in June, when 
commencement exercises will be 
held for the first time in Mead 
Chapel on the campus. 

Since 1809 all commencements 
have been held in the Congrega- 
tional meeting house, and the pro- 
cession o* trustees, faculty and 
graduates has marched the half 
mile from the campus to the im- 
pressive Colonial church. 

In expressing his regret at drop- 
ping the old custom, President Paul 
CD. Moody says that the 1938 grad- 
uating class is as large as the en- 
tire student body thirty years ago. 
The demand for admission to the 
commencement exercises is increas- 
ing annually, and the reconstruc- 
tion of the Mead chapel last Sum- 
mer with the addition of balconies 
makes the seating capacity of this 
building appreciably greater than 
that of the church 

RL. Duffus, journalist and au- 
thor of “Night Between Two 
Rivers,’’ is announced as the com- 
mencement speaker on June 13.

From a Staff Correspondent 


PRINCETON, N. J., April 30. 
Young Republicans were counseled 
here tonight by John D. M. Hamil- 


ton, Republican National Chairman, 


to join the party organization and 
to work within it for whatever re- 
forms they felt necessary. Only 
through party he told 
students from seventeen Eastern 
colleges and universities, delegates 
to the first Eastern Intercollegiate 
Republican Club Conference, can 
party unity and party strength be 
attained. 

Mr. Hamilton's address brought 
to a close a two-day conference the 
last day of which was ruled by 
acrimonious debate but which, as 
the result of an all-day session, pro- 
duced a platform its sponsors hoped 
would serve as a guiding light to 
Republican State and national plat- 
form makers of future years 

A feature of the morning and aft- 
ernoon sessions of the conference, 
held in Wiig Hal! on the Princeton 
campus, was a debate on the Lud- 
low anti-war referendum amend- 
ment The conference committee 
on foreign affairs had made no 
mention of the amendment in its 
report, but a resolution urging en- 
dorsement was offered from the 
floor. It was voted down by a one 
vote margin Platform planks 
adopted covered all phases of na- 
tional activity

Mr. Hamiiton told 
100 young men and women dele- 
gates at the closing dinner tonight 
in the Nassau Tavern. ‘‘And such 
things as you are doing here are 
very helpful to this cause. 

“T am a Republican and have 
been over a long period of years 
A Republican because my party has 
stood more generally for the things 
I believe in than have the Demo- 
crats and their candidates. When 
the day comes that I can no longer 
agree I'll leave the party but I will 
not stay in it as a troublemaker. 

‘Party discipline is necessary as 
is discipline in al! forms of organ- 
ization. No one, as a party mem- 
ber, has a right to raise issues ex- 
cept in party councils 

“You can’t join anything without 
the loss of independence, a political 
party or anything else. If you are 
going to give something of perma- 
nence do it as a party member and 
not as an independent. If you feel 
that some party official, no matter 
what his rank, should be thrown 
out, join the party and work for it. 
No party worker or official was 
ever kicked out save by those with 
a voice in the party councils.” 
The Republican party, Mr. Hamil- 
ton told the student Republicans, 
is no longer made up of the Old 
Guard, It is in effect, he said, an 
organization of at least near-youth. 
He urged all young Republicans to 
organize to aid the party, in cliques

Warm argument came 
first of the five general 
planks, the report of the foreign 
policy committee, and especially 
the subsidiary planks calling for 
adequate national defense The 
College Republicans, it developed 
favor defense but are opposed to 
“huge armament.”” They refused, 
however, by a vote of 28 to 
vote open opposition to the Nav; 
Construction Bill now before Con 
gress 

Proponents of the plan to com 
mend the Ludlow amendment ar 
gued that Americans should have 
the right to say whether they 
should die in war. Opponents con 
tended that the people of the na 
tion, because of limited informa 
tion, were not in a position to 
judge properly on the nation’s for 
eign affairs and perils 

At various points throughout the 
debate on the national 
phase of the platform, charges were 
hurled that opponents of armament 
were ‘notorious radicals Most of 
the charges were aimed against J 
Harland Cleveland, Princet 
ior, Rhodes scholar-elect and presi 
dent of the Princeton Anti-War So 
ciety. He had been absent on the 
first day of the conference with a 
university debating team. When he 
rose to speak there was a

RPI. RADIO BASES 
STUDENT RETICENCE 


English Department Program 
Aims to Develop Effective 
Use of Personality 


Specia] to THs New Yorx Times 

TROY, N. Y., April 30.—Rensse- 
laer Polytechnic Institute’s redio 
broadcasting station, WHAZ, is end- 
ing its sixteenth year with perhaps 
a thousand alumni engineers scat- 
tered over the world who are “‘im- 
mune to microphone fright and 
whose task of getting on in the 
world is probably helped more than 
they realize by the hours they spent 
in the studio.’’ 

Its value to the student body as 
a whole is judged in terms of extra- 
curricular activities that promote 
behind-the-scenes familiarity with 
radio, confidence before the micro- 
phone, interest in public speaking, 
debating, dramatics, music and a 
careful attention to diction in effec- 
tive expression. 

Such activities, in the opinion of 
Rensselaer’s Cepartment of Eng- 
lish, which supervises the student 
programs, contribute much to an 
effective use of personalities both 
in and beyond college 

‘This particular training could 
not be pursued but for the radio 
station, since we find that students 
good in speaking, acting or debat- 
ing before audiences, where they 
are stimulated by response, are 
often awed >y the impersonality 
of the radio studio,’’ says Pro- 
fessor Homer H. Nugent. ‘‘On the 
other hand, some students are at- 
tracted to radio and not to the 
stage or platform. Since education, 
the professions, business and gov- 
ernment will be increasingly inter- 
preted to the people through radio, 
we hope to train effective spokes- 
men.” 


B.U. Has Raised Nearly Halt of $1,150,000 


For New Business Administration Building 


Specia! to THe New YorK Times 


BOSTON, April 
816.30 already pledged toward the 
$1,150,000 fund for the new home of 
the Boston University College of 
3Zusiness Administration, students, 
alumni and friends of the institution 
are looking forward confidently 
toward a speedy climax of the cam- 
paign begun only seven weeks ago 
More than 300 graduates attended 
a dinner meeting this week to plan 
the final phase of the drive. 

The two largest gifts in this total 
were contributed by an individual 
and a foundation. _John Shepard ax 


tribution to tne university. Josiah 
W. Hayden, president of the Charles 
Hayden Foundation of New York, 
gave $100,000. 

Surprising happenings have 
marked the progress of the build- 
ing fund campaign. Recently a con- 
ribution arrived by clipper airship

from half-way around the 
world. It was a check from a grad- 
uate of the journalism department 
who, following newspaper experi- 
ences in most of the countries of 
the world, is now settled in Hono- 
lulu This gift has the record in 
distance from Boston 

Dean Everett W. Lord, veteran 
dean of the college for the past 
twenty-five years, was surprised by 
another gift from this same gradu- 
ate. Mailed by airship to Los An- 
geles and thence by air to Boston, 
a snowy white iei, opened forty- 
eight hours after it had been packed 
in Hawaii, was dropped over the 
dean's white head. 

The new business administration 
building will be the first university 
building to be erected on the new 
campus site bordered by Common- 
wealth Avenue and the Charles 
River.

throughout the program. 

Mr. Monteux'’s return effected 
several changes in the seating of 
the orchestra, namely, that the 
basses and ‘celli exchanged their 
places on the left of the stage with 
the violas, battery and harps. The 
other sections remained in their 
customary places. Other than obvi- 
ous differences in the origins of the 
several sounds within the studio | 
itself, there was no substantial 
change—for good or bad 
tal orchestral tone, though outside 
reception may have been improved. 
More likely the change was made to 
suit Mr. Monteux’s particular habits 
in conducting—a change wholly 
within his right 

Beethoven's Second symphony, in 
D major, conventional in its inter- 
pretation and lacking the finesse of 
which the NBC orchestra is capa- 
ble, opened the evening. On the 
basis of last night's performances, 
Mr. Monteux’s native sympathy is 
for romantic and modern rather 
than classic musical thought. Both 
Schumann’s ‘‘Manfred’’ Overture 
and the Dukas ‘‘La Péri’’ generated 
heat and color and a personal re- 
sponse that were missing in the 
symphony Strauss’s ‘‘Don Juan” 
concluded the program. G.G. 


Concert at Town Hall 


A concert and chamber 
music was given last night at Town 
Hall under the auspices of the 
American Committee for the Settle- 
ment of Jews in Birobidjan. The 
participating artists were the Perole 
String Quartet, Rose Kunst, mezzo- 
soprano, and Victor Chenkin, who 
sang folk and character songs. 

The Perole ensemble began the 
evening with the Boccherini Quar- 
tet, Op. 33, No. 6, and the Debussy 
Quartet in G minor, Op. 10. These 
works were followed by Miss Kunst’s 
singing of the aria ‘‘Adieu Forets"’ 
rom Tchaikovsky's “Jeanne d’Are.”’ 
Mr. Chenkin offered groups of Rus- 
sian folk songs, impersonations by 
song of the poet Pierre Jean dea 
Beranger, songs of the Caucasus 
and Yiddish songs.

comedy, ‘‘Money Talks,’ at the Ly- 
ceum on Wednesday. It is adapted 
from a French play which had an 
eight-month Paris run. It will show 
Hicks as a financier who, after a 
jailbreak, makes good as a night 
watchman in a corset establishment 
and finally a prosper- 
ous banker arranging a loan for his 
country. In addition to Hicks, the 
east of thirty includes Cathleen 
Nesbitt as elderly upright em- 
ployer, Eliot Makeham in one of 
his famous old man studies and 
Jane Carr as the leading lady.

YOUNG'S CHARGES 


Continued From “age One 


cent control of the C. & O. Both 
sides asked the Guaranty for help 
in placing directors on the Chesa- 
peake Corporation board, Mr. Pot- 
ter disclosed. 

The Guaranty Trust Company 
consistently refused to take sides in 
the controversies that had _ de- 
continued Mr. Potter. ‘It 
efforts *to solve 


veloped 
made numerous 
these controversies in the hope that 
additional independent directors 
satisfactory to both groups might 
be elected to the board of the 
Chesapeake Corporation. All of 
these efforts failed, largely due to 
the objections of Mr. Young. There- 
after Mr. Bradley, as president of 
the Chesapeake Corporation, on his 
own responsibility, called a special 
meeting of stockholders for the 
purpose of electing three additional 
directors 

“On the basis of the claim of mo- 
mentary appreciation in value, Al- 
leghany Corporation demanded that 
Guaranty Trust Company turn over 
to it all money, then amounting to 
$300,273, representing income re- 
eived on securities pledged as col- 
lateral for the bonds due in 1944 
and held for the benefit of such 
bonds.”’ 

Earle Bailie of J. & W. Seligman 
& Co., John L. Dickinson, presi- 
dent of the Kanawha Valley Bank 

Charleston, W. Va., and John B. 
Hollister of the law firm of Taft, 
Stettinius & Hollister, Cincinnati, 
have been selected as additional di- 
rectors for the Chesapeake Corpora- 
tion and the C. & O,. by the Guar- 


“Chesapeake Corporation ineluding 


the question of the election of a 
board of directors of the Chesa- 
peake & Ohio Railway at the an- 
nual meeting."’ 


Control by Young Opposed 


“Despite these facts,’’ continued 
Mr. Potter, ‘‘Mr. Young and oth- 
ers have continued to assert that 
the Guaranty Trust Company and 
Messrs. Bailie, Dickinson and Hol- 
lister are seeking to overthrow the 
management of the Chesapeake & 
Ohio Railway. Messrs. Bailie, Dick- 
inson and Hollister have advised 
us that they had planned not to 
take any stand in the controversies 
between Mr. Young and his oppo- 
nents until the conclusion of the 
legal proceedings, but that in view 
of these continued misrepresenta- 
tions to security holders and oth- 
ers they have decided to make 
their position clear without further 
delay. 

“They have further advised us 
that they believe that the present 
operating management of the rail- 
way is efficient and should be con- 
tinued and that they are advising 
the stockholders of the ~ailway of 
their position and are asking the 
stockholders to support them for 
election as independnt directors of 
the railway. 

‘*‘We have full confidence in the 
position taken by Messrs. Bailie, 
Dickinson and Hollister and the de- 


cisions which they have reached. | 


We also have full confidence in the 
present operating management of 
the railway, but we believe that the 
company should not continue to be 


subject to the control of Mr. Young. | 


We believe that the election of 
Messrs. Bailie, Dickinson and Hol- 
lister as independent directors of 
the Chesapeake Corporation and of 
the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway 
will be for the best interest of bond- 
holders of Alleghany Corporation.’’ 

‘The statement of the Guaranty 
Trust Company that I have control 
of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway 
is absurd,” said Mr. Young in his 
reply. 

“IT have done everything In my

GUARANTY DENIES 


| voice, voting 42 per cent of the out- 


standing stock for the management 
proxy committee consisting of H. B. 
Erminger, Herbert Fitzpatrick and 
G. D. Brooke, all associated with 
the railway for many years. 


“Invasion by Guaranty Trust’’ 


“Since that date thousands of ad- 
ditional stockholders have rallied to 
support the C. & O. Railway against 
this invasion by the Guaranty 
Trust, Today the management has 
received proxies from more than 
37,000 stockholders representing 
more than 75 per cent of the own- 
ers of C. & O. stock. This contrasts 
with the 34 per cent of C. & O. 
stock which Alleghany Corporation 
contends the Guaranty Trust is at- 
tempting illegally to vote to oust 
the C. & O. management for its 
own selfish ends. 

“Officers of the Guaranty Trust 
are on record in their sworn affi- 
davits as denying any intention to 
change the C. & O. management. 
It is not consistent with these state- 
ments for these officers now to 
strain themselves to overthrow that 
management. If they really wished 
to maintain the management, they 
would allow it to go on about its 
duties and gracefully accept the de- 
feat administered to them (Guar-| 
anty) on April 19 by the overwhelm- | 
ing voice of those 37,000 stockhold- | 
ers who really have a vital interest 
in the welfare of the C. & O. 


Only Representative on Board 


“Alleghany, which owns 34 per | 
cent of the C. & O. stock, pledged 
with the Guaranty Trust, has only 
one representative on the C. & O, 
board. I am that representative 
There are seven other members of 
the C. & O. board, most of whom 
are of long standing. I am neither | 
an officer of the C. & O. nor a 
member of its proxy committee of 
three, 

“It is an insult to the intelligence | 
of the public for the Guaranty 
Trust to say that I control the C 
4 O., or have any desire to control 
it, when I am doing everything in

a bear market ahead of the higher priced “blue chips’. In the 
early stages of recovery, low priced issues often show unusual

period.

| ment may determine, at its own 
| discretion, what constitutes grounds 
for expropriation in the public in- 
terest; that Mexican independence 
| is not subject to question; that the 
property in question was owned by 
the Mexican Eagle Oil Company, 
organized under Mexican law, and 
this precluded intervention of a for- 
¢ign government in its behalf. The 
reply further contended that there 
had been no denial of justice, as 
the company had not exhausted all 
of its remedies before the Mexican 
courts. 

On April 5 the oil companies, 
both British and American, had ap- 
pealed to the Mexican District 
Court in Mexico City for an injunc- 
tion against the expropriation ac- 
tion on the ground that it violated 
the Constitution of Mexico. Al- 
though the American oil companies 
maintained that all legal recourse 
in Mexican courts had been ex- 
hausted when the properties were 
seized, it is understood that this 
additional court action was taken 
at the suggestion of the State De- 
partment in Washington. 

Almost immediately after the in- 
junction was asked for, the court 
fixed Sept. 29 as the date of the 
first hearing. This date, however, 
yas subsequently stepped up to 
May 11. A period of many years 
might elapse before the question is 
finally determined by the Mexican 
Supreme Court, all justices of 
which are personal appointees of 
President Cardenas and serve only 
for his term of office. Pending the 
final adjudication of the constitu- 
tional question involved, the Mexi- 
can Government shows no inclina- 
tion relinquish possession and 
management of the expropriated 
properties,

Leon Trotsky Takes a Part 


In its note of April 21, the British 
Foreign Office took an entirely dif- 
ferent view of the question of the 
exhaustion of local remedies. That 
note again demanded the return of 
the oil properties, pointing out that 
there had been a denial of justice, 
although the case was still nominal- 
ly in the Mexican courts. It fur- 
ther declared that a long period 
may elapse before adjudication of 
the proceedings in the Mexican 
courts; that the Mexican Govern- 
ment is not awaiting the outcome 
of the proceedings, and that great 
damage already had been inflicted 
on British stockholders, which may 
become irreparable before the pro- 
ceedings are ended. 

Almost immediately 
ceipt of the second British note, 
Leon Trotsky, now living in Mexico, 
who previously had not been identi- 
fied with Mexican oil seizure, 
projected himself into the diplo 
matic negotiations. In a letter to

Government the right of control 
over interior politics and juris-| 
prudence in an independent coun- | 
try? 

“The British Government, which 
is accustomed to disposing freely 
of hundreds of miliions of colonial | 
slaves and semi-slaves, endeavors 
to apply the same methods to Mex- 
ico. Having found a valiant opposi- 
tion, Britain had charged her jurist 
with the hurried invention of argu- 
ments in which judicial logic is re- 
placed by imperialistic cynicism.” 

Mr. Trotsky advises the British 
Labor party to name “a special 
committee charged with the inves- 
tigation of British capital, as well 
as foreign, invested in Mexico.” 
Such a committee, he said, ‘‘would 
in a short time be able to offer to 
British public opinion impressive 
information of the imperialistic ex- 
ploitation.”’ 

Denying that he initiated the ex- 
propriation of the oil properties as 
had been charged in some news- 
papers, Mr. Trotsky, in a postscript 
to his letter, said that ‘‘as a private 
citizen, enjoying the hospitality of 
Mexico, I learned from the news- 
papers each of the steps being taken 
in the fight of foreign capitalists 
against Mexican laws. That was 
quite sufficient to form an opinion. 
To express such opinion in a loud 
voice is the cardinal! duty of all who 
participate in the fight for the free- 
dom of the proletariat.”’ 

So far, the efforts of both the 
United States and the British Gov- | 
ernments to obtain the return of 
the oil properties has not met with 
any success. The second British 
note was answered by Mexico on 
April 26, in a tone similar to that 
first. 

The Mexican Government is ex- 
periencing difficulty in operating 
the oil properties. Their productive 
capacity has bee~ reduced to about 
25 per cent of the volume prior to 
the seizure. The opposition to dis- 
posing of the surplus oil has re-| 
sulted in the export movement de- | 
clining to less than 10 per cent of | 
its former rate. Mexican labor has 
received none of the wage increases 
nor benefits promised under the 
decision of the Mexican Supreme 
Court, but, on the contrary has lost 
many of the advantages formerly 
enjoyed. There also has been a 
marked reduction in employment.

securities in which he is so regis- 
tered. 

(c). No registered firm carry- 
ing margin accounts for cus- 
tomers shall, for any account in 
which the firm has a direct or in- 
direct interest, effect any trans- 
action in any security, or shall 
permit any withdrawal of capital 
by a partner, if such transaction 
or withdrawal would create or in- 
crease an excess of the firm’s po- 
sition in securities, computed at 
market value, over 25 per cent of 
its net working capital. In de- 
termining the working capital, 
the value of Exchange member- 
ships, furniture and other fixed or 
illiquid assets shall be excluded. 
In determining the position of the 
firm in securities, there shall be 
excluded securities exempted 
without action by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission from 
the registration requirements of 
the Securities E&change Act of 
1934 and any position in a secur- 
ity acquired lawfully by an under- 
writer in connection with its un- 
derwriting of a primary or sec- 
ondary distribution of such secur- 
ity otherwise than on a national 
securities exchange, provided the 
acquisition of such position is 
first approved by the Exchange, 
in writing, as not detrimental to 
the interests of customers of the 
firm or any partner thereof. As 
used in this paragraph, the term 
“registered firm’’ shall include 
any memer of the Exchange en- 
gaged in the brokerage business 
as an individual. 

(d). The provisions of Par- 

agraph (c) of this rule shall not 
apply to any banking institution 
which is supervised and examined 
by State or Federal authority hav- 
ing supervision over banks. 
The proposed rules would not pro- 
partners of commis- 
sion houses from borrowing from 
the banks on securities owned by 
such partners. Conflict of inter- 
ests between firms and their part- 
ners and their customers would be 
averted by the limitations which 
wou'd be placed on the position 
which the firms or their partners 
were able to take in any security. 

The matter of any restrictions 
which may be felt necessary as to 
withdrawal of capital or for other 
financial safeguards in connection 
with firms which do not carry mar- 
gin accounts for customers will be 
studied by the SEC in the light of 
the testimony taken in connection 

ith the failure of Richard Whitney

GERMANY CRAMPED, 
BANK MEN BELIEVE 


Some Hold She Quit Fair Here 
Because Barter Trading 
Wanes With Price Rise 


HINT SECRET ‘WAR CHEST’ 


One View Is That False Data 
Hide Hoarding of Funds 
for Military Uses 


By CHARLES E. EGAN 

Opinions on Germany’s actual fis- 
cal condition varied widely among 
bankers and traders last week as 
a result of the Reich’s announce- 
ment of withdrawal from the New 
York World's Fair. 

Foreign traders accepted at face 
value the claim by Germany that 
a shortage of available foreign ex 
change made it necessary for her 
to cancel plans for participating in 
the 1939 event. Exporters, importers 
and bankers involved in interna- 
tional trade, it was evident, are not 
in accord with the popular’ belief 
that Germany’s resentment over 
this country’s refusal to sell her 
helium gas lies behind the with- 
drawal. 

Expressing private opinions here 
yesterday, bankers agreed on the 
fact that Germany probably has no 
money available for use in financ- 
ing an elaborate display at the fair, 
since the money she has on hand 
is earmarked for other uses. 


Secret Hoard Rumored 


Some bankers, who have kept in 
touch with the situation in 
the Reich, insist that Germany 
could produce the money if she 
wished but that she is purposely 
making her fiscal position appear 
worse than it actually is in order to 
cover the building up of a secret 
“war chest Those holding this 
view contend that the Hitler regime 
has been acquiring gold secretly for 
the last several years and has hoard- 
ed the metal against a day when 
the outbreak of war in Europe may 
find her forced to pay cash for 
needed supplies 

Details of the ‘‘war chest’’ have 
been closely guarded, it was said. 
The tight control exercised by the 
government over budgetary and 
other fiscal information, bankers 
maintain, makes the task of divert- 
ing exchange into a war fund a 
comparatively easy matter. 

One group of bankers maintains 
that Germany’s financial condition 
is just as precarious as foreign na- 
tions have been led to believe. In 
spite of the additional capital ob- 
tained through her acquisition of 
Austria, it was argued, the strain 
of financing extensive imports of 
necessary raw materials is proving 
too great for the nation. Those 
holding this view link the recent 
decree for confiscation of the hold- 
ings of Jews, particularly their for- 
elgn possessions, to the pressure for 
more capital 


Barter Called Failure 


Foreign traders are interested in 
Germany’s withdrawal because they 
interpret the action as an admission 
that the barter system of trade 
under which she has operated for 
several years, is not proving a suc- 
cess Higher prices for German 
goods, necessitated by increased 
manufacturing costs, have reduced 
the demand abroad for exports, it 
was argued, and made the nations 
of Latin America and of Central 
and Southern Europe less amen- 
able to German offers to exchange 
merchandise credits for raw mate- 
rials. German prices are now 10 to 
15 per cent higher than a year ago, 
according to reliable estimates. 

The Franco-British agreement to 
purchase large quantities of raw 
materials from the South and Cen- 
tral European nations, which have 
been trading only with Germany 
under compensation agreements, 
will aggravate Germany’s trade dis- 
comfiture, it was pointed out. 

Regarding ‘Germany’s action as 
an admission of weakness, Ameri- 
can exporters propose to intensify 
their cultivatian of South American 
markets where Germany has been 
a serious competitor in recent 
years. They intend to capitalize on 
the fact that the Reich’s three 
years of barter trade with Brazil 
and other countries has left her 
without a foreign exchange balance 
of any proportions and proved the 
system of barter impractical. 

Exporters plan to tell Latin-Amer- 
ican customers that higher prices 
now existing on German goods are 
the direct result of the nation’s at- 
tempts at complete self-sufficiency. 


MAIL ORDERS RECEDE:: 
SUMMER GOODS TAKEN 


Some Demand at Wholesale Is 
for Off Prices 


Although mail orders in the whole- 
sale markets here last week were 
slightly lighter than in the previous 
week, there was some increased 
activity on Summer merchandise, 
according to a report prepared espe- 
cially for THE New York TIMes 
by McGreevey, Werring & Howell 
Company, resident buyers. 

‘Calls were received for off-price 
black and navy dresses in popular 
price ranges,’’ the report said, con- 
tinuing: ‘‘Quantity orders were 
placed for white and pastel man- 
tailored suits in light fabrics to re- 
tail at $7.95 and up. Fitted reefer- 
type unlined Summer coats, in both 
white and hairline stripes and in 
navy and black were ordered. Re- 
orders on evening wraps in taffetas, 
slipper satins and bengalines to 
retail from $5.95 to $16.95 were 
placed 

“Dress department orders cen- 
tered on printed chiffon voiles to 
retail at $7.95 and cotton laces at 
$10. Heavy requests were noted in 
$16.95 and $19.95 spectator sports 
dresses, crépe jacket dresses. Eve- 
ning dresses in marquisette and in 
lace types were ordered. Popular- 
price dresses were wanted in sheer 
types, both on open orders and re- 
orders. Basement dress divisions 
were active, with rayon acetate 
shantung numbers getting emphasis 
Wash frocks were taken to retail at 
$1.95 to $3.95. 


Barton to Speak on ‘More Jobs’ 


Representative Bruce Barton will 
speak on ‘“‘More Jobs—A Fresh 
Viewpoint on Our Biggest Prob-

Of Tires Are Planned 


A definite trend to reducing the 
number of styles and price brack-

manufacturers will get under way 
the end of this year, an 
executive of one of the leading 
companies predicted here yester- 
day. While the opposite develop- 
ment has in effect for sev- 
eral years now, he points out, the 
industry has gradually come to 
realize the wastefulness 
in the multiplicity of models, 
sizes and prices now available

for lower quotations on existing 
lines has been exerted by retail 
buyers for some time, but manufac- 
turers have insisted that thev can- 
not lower prices while production 
costs remain at present levels 

Many producers who have been 
adamant against price cuts, have 
discussed the possibility of creating 
new and lower price ranges for 
some special goods. At least a score 
of such offerings in low-price 
ranges are looked for at the Chi- 
cago display 

At the Jamestowr market opening 
last week only a few of the pro- 
ducers participating had goods in 
new _low brackets, but reports here

Since quart prices on domestic 
liquors were brought down last Fall 
to a point where they were competi- 
tive with Scotch, distillers said, 
they have had exceptional success 
in competing with the imported 
whiskies. The bonded liquor now 
is sold around $3.29 a quart By 
using the smaller fifth bottle, pro- 
ducers believe, they can bring the 
price for that size below $3, and 
create a striking price contrast 
with the Scotches.

Roosevelt and Business 


“In all of this,” said President Roose- 


ty velt on April 14 when recommending 
de- | 


his renewed program of government 
outlay for economic recovery, “govern- 
ment cannot and should not act alone. 
Business must help. I am sure business 
will help.” 

Last week cooperation was offered 
by sixteen outstanding business leaders, 
each the head of an important bank, 


| insurance company or industrial firm, 


representing an aggregate of billions of | 
dollars of capital. Among them were | 


} 
| 


Corporation and Winthrop W. Aldrich 


| of the Chase National Bank. Through 
| John W. Hanes, a former Wall Street 


broker recently appointed to the Secur- | 
ities and Exchange Commission, they 
submitted to the White House a state- | 
ment which said: 


We should all resolve to encour- 
age the President in every effort he 
shall make to restore confidence and 
normal business conditions, and to 
support Congress in the position that 
its legislative program should be di- 
rected for national recovery for em- 
ployer and employe alike rather than 
toward the enactment of legislation 
based upon untried social and eco- 
nomic theories. 


Although the final -clause of the | 


| above-quoted paragraph implied some 
| reservations, President Roosevelt pro- 


the document “excellent.” | 
Through ,Commissioner Hanes he | 
thanked the signers and said he would | 
welcome more specific suggestions. 

A seventeenth business leader, not 
connected with the others, made a per- 
sonal appearance at the White House 
last week. Henry Ford had been invited 
to lunch with the President, the first 


| overtures having been made by G. Hall

The visit caused a sensation in Wash-

said at the two-hour White House 
luncheon, attended by oniy a few close 
advisers of the protagonists. Mr. Ford, 
emerging into the outer office, rushed

of other things. His words made it 


plain that President Roosevelt had not | 
won him over from his. well-known | 


views on the relation of government 
to industry. 


Message on Monopolies 


had President 


Nor, it appeared, 


Roosevelt been diverted from his well- | 


known opposition to concentrated con- 
trol of business. On Friday he sent to 
Congress his long-awaited message on 
monopoly, deciaring: “The power of a 
few to manage the econoniic life of the 
nation must be diffused among the 
many or transferred to the public and 
its democratically responsible govern- 
ment.” 

His message urged: (1) More funds 
for the Department of Justice to en- 
force existing anti-trust laws; (2)a 
study by three Federal agencies to 
guide Congress in tightening those laws 
at a subsequent session; and (3) legis- 
lation at the present session to restrict 
bank-holding companies. 

Another part of the Président’s pro- 
gram, the Wages and Hours Bill, rec- 
ommended by him in repeated mes- 
sages to Congress, came to grief last 
week whén the House Rules Commit- 
tee refused to expedite a vote on it. 
Five Southern Democrats on the com- 
mittee, fearing that Federal legislation 
would erase the South’s industrial at- 
traction of cheap labor, defied 
President’s will. To bring the measure 
to the floor despite the cornmittee’s ac- 
tion would require an elaborate parlia- 
mentary procedure for which there may 
not be time before Congress adjourns.

regularly clip interest coupons from 
more than $50,000,000,000 in Federal,

Wisconsin Ideas 


The Idea,” forty years 
ago, was a new philosophy of govern- 
and Robert M. La Follette was 
its prophet. A man who had fought 
his way from a log cabin to the Gov- 
emmorship of Wisconsin, La Follette de- 
manded—and eventually got—direct 
primaries, equitable taxation, utility- 
rate control, the advice of experts in

United States Senate in 1905, and re- 
He re- 
a stanch crusader for 
progressive liberalism. In 1924 he led 
the most vigorous third-party cam- 
paign in American history; as an in- 
dependent Progressive candidate for 
President he polled nearly 5,000,000 
votes in a total of slightly over 29,000,- 
000. The next year he died.

Until 1934 the brothers remained, 
like their father, nominal Republicans, | 
though in 1932 they supported Roose- 
velt. Four years ago they broke away | 
from the party confines and set up 
their own Progressive organization, 
but in 1936 they again supported | 
Roosevelt for the Presidency. Last 
week that organization was expanded 
and launched as the National Progres-

the direct leadership of Philip La Fol-

The new party was born Thursday 
night in the stock pavilion at the 
University of Wisconsin in Madison. 
The pavilion, packed with 5,000 people, 
reeked and steamed with the odor of 
prize cattle from Wisconsin's famous 
dairy farms. While waiting’ for the 
speaking to begin the crowd, seated on 
hard benches, sang the “Battle Hyma 
of the Republic,” “America the Beauti- | 
ful” and the famous football song, “On | 
Wisconsin.” Members of the univer- 
sity’s athletic teams, a big “W” on 
each red sweater, acted as ushers and 
held back the crowd that sought to 
pile into the pavilion from a cold 


drizzle outside. 


Progressive Manifesto 


Governor La Follette, the chief | 
speaker, declared ten years of tempo- 
rizing with the depression had brought 
us back where we started. He ruled 
out socialism and fascism as cures. 
He called for a new approach. He de- 
clared: “A new movement, the Nation- 
al Progressives of America, is under 
way. * * * Make no mistake, this is not 
a third party. As certain as the sun 
rises, we are launching the party of 
our time.” 

Six tenets were listed in what | 
amounted to a manifesto: (1) Public | 
ownership and management of money 
and credit: (2) restoration of the right 
of every one to earn an honest living; 
(3) reorganization of executive govern- 
ment things done” without 
dictatorial (4) security for 
farmers and workers; (5) an end of 
“coddling or spoonfeeding the Amer- 
ican people”; (6) belief in the sacred 
destiny of the Western Hemisphere as 
a place where “man should work out 
the final act in the great drama of 
life.”

Thus was a new party born, com-

representing the union of “our people

in New York, he de-

Mr. Barbirolli—he will not be 38 until | 

next December—has been a musician 

all his life. He began to play the violin 

at 8, then shifted to the cello, because 

when playing the violin he walked 

about too much during practice. From 

early boyhood bandmasters fascinated 

him. Sooner or later, he hoped, he too 

would become a baton-wielder. While 

in the army efter the war he did lead 

a regimental orchestra, and a few years

Most shocking of 
all, the basic income tax, already at its 
highest peace-time level of 25 per cent, 
was raised to 271. This rate will apply 
to income beyond the exemptions for

$675 of earnings. There continues, in 
addition,.a surtax on incomes above 
$10,000. 

When Sir John had finished telling 
of these increases, explaining that they 
were “for the protection of our native 
land,” there was not a murmur of the 
customary applause from any part of 
the House. Laborites were bitter be- 
cause the National Government had 
failed to impose a limit on the soaring 
profits of manufacturers who are mak-

had net seen them for twenty-two 
years. They were taken as a trophy 


in the quickly suppressed Easter up- 


rising of 1916, when Mr. de Valera’s | 


Sinn Feiners sought to gain their in- 
dependence while Britain was busy 
fighting Germany. 


Centuries-Old Struggle 


That uprising was not the last in- 
cident in the 700-year-old struggle be- 
tween the two great islands of the Brit- 
ish Isles. It was but a prelude to the 


| guerrilla “Anglo-Irish War,” 1919-21.

retaliated with high tariffs on Trish | 


produce, and Dublin in turn raised the 
rates on British manufactures. 


International Trade 


In a new treaty signed last week at 
10 Downing Street—a ceremony capped 
by the return of Mr. de Valera’s field 
glasses—the economic war was called 
off. The prohibitive duties were 
rescinded and a three-year preferential 
trade agreement, similar to those 
among other units of the British Em- 
pire, was adopted. In final settlement 
of the land annuities and other claims, 
for which Britain had asked £4,700,000 
a year, the government of Eire agreed 


of £10,000,000. 
Simultaneously with this economic 
settlement the British Government 


turned over to Dublin the control of | 
| Harlem, citizens protested against the 


naval and coast defense establishments 
at three Irish ports—Cobh, Bere Haven 
and Lough Swilly—which it had re- 
served under the 1921 treaty. By thus 
granting a greater degree of the nom- 
inal independence which Mr. de Valera 
sought, the British believed they had 
increased their hope of relying on Irish 
cooperation in time of war.

Japan’s War Worries 

Early last July there was a Russo- 
Japanese war scare. Tokyo and Mos- 
cow were excited about an “incident” 
on the Manchukuoan-Siberian border— 
a clash between patrol forces disputing 
possession of two tiny, uninhabited 
islands in the Amur River. That scare 
was diverted when actual though un- 
declared war began a few days later 
between Japan and China. 

A dispatch from Moscow last week 
revealed that there were enough “‘inci-

ACADEMICIAN: The Royal Acad- 
emy, most famous and dignified of 
British art bodies, has frequently been 
attacked by artists as conventional, as 
“dead.” Controversy 
has often arisen * 
from the academy's 
conservatism. It did 
last week. Augustus 
John, frequently 
called the greatest 
living British artist, 
resigned from the 
academy when it re- 
fused to hang in its 
annual! exhibition 
Wyndham Lewis's portrait of the poet 
T. S. Eliot. Mr. John, associated with 
the academy for nearly two decades, | 
had never felt at home with his fellow- 
academicians. 

Now a man of 60, Mr. John was once 
regarded as an artistic rebel, a leader 
of the younger British school, but any 
rebelliousness he may have shown did 
not prevent his becoming a portrait- | 
painter to the great. Stresemann, Law- 
rence of Arabia, Ramsay MacDonald, 
Andrew W. Mellon were among his 

aitters. A few years ago he startled

| one day last week on the floor of the 


Senate. From the rear of the chamber

would be chiefly responsible. 

Doubtless also the prod of the 
La Follette meeting at Madison 
| was felt. For, despite a loose im- 
pression that the dominant poli- 
ticians of Wisconsin are wild 
radicals, their platform of Thurs- 
day night is almost pure Wil- 
sonian, largely acceptable to the 
traditional Democrats. In style 
and context this platform made 
some of the New Deal acts and 
writings appear adolescent and 
faintly alien, 

Signal for Brakes 

With such a threat from what 
was supposed to be the Left, but 
looks strangely like the Center, 
of anti-conservatism, the Admin- 
istration should be prompted by 
the mere dictates of common sense 
to encourage business and let 
crusading await the return of 
prosperity. A President can in- 
fluence Congress only when he 
commands the support of groups 
making a majority, however shift- 
ing. 

On Mr. Roosevelt’s moving 
majority the popular interests rep- 
resented vaguely by the La Fol- 
lettes have always been essential. 
Witness the domination of TVA by 
their disciple, Mr. Lilienthal, who 
also has the blessing of radical- 
ism’s Nestor, Senator Norris. The 
President has catered to this polit- 
ical sector in many ways. 

Amid the host of threats and 
dangers—from Southern conserva- 
tives, from Democrats who are 
anti-New Dealers for general rea- 
from the Madisonites and 
maverick allies, and from 
the indices of business—it would 
be a very blind administration 
which would not stop, look and 
listen, or a very reckless admin- 
istration which would take the 
position “after.us, the deluge.” 
Glimmer of Light 

The President still appears too 
intent on proving himself the 
savior of capitalism to be disposed 
to echo Louis XV. And, though 
the blindness of folly has ofttimes 
seemed incurable hereabouts, light 
apparently is now penetrating. 

This is the record and prospect 
of a week generally more con- 
structive than a long previous 
period. Nothing has been solved, 
and certainly not the depression. 
Possibly it cannot be until our 
governing influence is one which 
will hold, in the words of Madison, 
Wis.: “We shall use * * * power 
* © * to restore to every American 
the opportunity to help himself. 
After that, he can sink or swim.” 

But there are tangible move- 
ments toward solutions.

of what they desire. Separated, 
the aspect is different. What has 
Britain to give Italy that she can 
give her without sacrificing empire 
interests? Only one. thing—finan- 
cial assistance; and dictatorship not 
only had proved its ability to sus- 
tain itself on a financial vacuum, 
but seems prepared to continue the 
process. 

For instance, it is generally under- 
stood that the Reich Government 
spent upward of 20,000,000 marks 
on the entertainment of Mussolini 
when he visited Germany last Fall. 
It is pretty well established that 
Italy is almost doubling that ex- 
penditure on the preparations to 
welcome Hitler. Yet Italy is gen- 
erally accounted to be in the most 
extreme financial straits. As to 
German finances, the world has 
long ago given up all attempts to 
comprehend them or to divine 
where the money comes from. 

Thus far there has apparently 
been no limit to the resources ob- 
tainable within the thoroughly regi- 
mented States. There must be a 
limit eventually, of course, but 
many things may happen before it 
is reached. 


Anglo-Italian Pact 

In Italy’s case a preliminary to a 
settlement with the democratic 
has been reached in the 
Anglo-Italian agreement It must 
not be forgotten, however, that this 
agreement is wholly provisional 
and contingent upon a satisfactory 
solution of a number of situations 
still in the course of development. 

Before entering upon negotiations 
with Germany Britain must be 
strong. All her preliminary moves 
are being based upon this need for 
strengthening herself diplomatically 
and materially. Gradually and most 
unwillingly it has become recog- 
nized in England that Britain alone

The South Wales Echo 


Walker in 





it is becoming more and more ap- 
parent that despite the» financial 
troubles and economic hardships 
under the dictatorships this is fast 
tending to become a crucial year in 
European affairs. Events are mov- 
ing faster than probably even the 
dictators desire. The absorption of 
Austria has galvanized the « Ger- 


mans of Czechoslovakia into unity | 


and the demand for action in their 


behalf is too strong for the wire-| 


pullers in Berlin to ignore even if 
they wished to. There is littl doubt 
that the future of Czechoslovakia 
will be decided this Summer. There 
is scarcely less doubt what that fu- 
ture will be. 


Only Form of Attack Changes 
The form of attack upon Czecho- 
slovakia—for it is nothing less— 
changes from time to time, but 
always with the same objective. At 
this writing Hungary is being put 
forward as its spearhead. The Hun- 
garian press with one accord and 
scarcely on its own initiative is now 
openly demanding the partition of 
Czechoslovakia, with Hungary and 
Poland each obtaining her share of 
the spoils. The world is being made 
familiar with the idea of Czechoslo- 
vakia’s disappearance as a State. 
Meantime, in the immediate fore- 
ground are the eight demands of 
Konrad Henlein, the Sudeten Ger- 
man leader, the concession of 
which would mean the utter wreck- 
ing of Czechoslovakia’s indepen- 
dence and the conversion of what 
was left of her, after her minori- 
ties had been satisfied, into a Ger- 


German aggression; but Russian 
assistance is contingent upon 
France’s setting the _ initiative. 
There are no means by which 
troops of France could reach 
Czechoslovakia without violating 
the neutrality of the countries be- 
tween them. France, therefore, 
could help only by attacking Ger- 
many directly. How many French- 
men will be willing to mobilize 
against Germany to save Czecho- 
slovakia no matter what pledges 
have been given in their behalf? 
The writer put this question to a 
well-informed American, resident in 
Paris for many years, who was vis- 


| iting Berlin this week. 
‘Not enough to form a single | 
| division, 


’”” answered the American 
unhesitatingly. ‘I have been in- 
terested in that question myself and 
have made careful inquiries cover- 
ing all classes of the population. 
The answers were all the same: 
‘Fight Germany for Czechoslo- 
vakia? Invite again the horrors of 
the last war for a country with 
which we have only the slightest 
relations? Not us.” Any French 
Government that seemed about to 
take such a rash step would not 
last an hour.”’ 

Attitude of Others 

is clear, despite the 
noncommittal statements of her 
Prime Minister, is doing her utmost 
to stave off forceful action in Cen- 
tral Europe, Italy has already 
avowed herself as wholly disinter- 
ested in Czechoslovakia’s future.

by a revisionist dream, may be re-

Already the Czechs are being ad- | 
vised by fair weather friends to

Nevertheless, the prospect is that 
the resources of totalitarianism will 


find a way to deal with Czechoslo- | 
vakia by internal combustion and |

| Negotiations Delayed 


without war. 


British negotiations with Ger- 


| many are unlikely to begin imme-| 


diately because it is obvious they 
would be easier if this problem as 


| well as the Spanish problem were 


out of the way first. Whether a 


|newly expanded Germany and a 
| triumphant Italy will be easier to 
| deal with after the expansion and | 


the Spanish triumph is a psycho- 


| logical question that perhaps might 
| be considered, but apparently it is 
| not being taken into account. 


Official Germany, meantime, is 


wholly content with the way things 
| are going. Herr Henlein’s speech, it 
needed | 


is said, has contributed a 
clarification of the Reich’s position 
te 
“‘realities’’ therein 
revealed. 

There is, however, a curiously 
one-sided tendency to demand, be- 
fore entering upon any negotiations 


| with Britain, that her relations with 


France be revised to conform more 
closely to those with Germany. 


A Difference Noted 
The Franco-British tie, it is com- 


' plained here, seems to be too much 


of a military alliance. It is far dif- 
ferent from any understanding that 
Britain seems to be seeking with 
Germany. Before dealing with 
Britain, therefore, it is desirable, 
the Germans think, that she modify 
her present arrangements with 
France to a basis similar to what 
she seeks to establish with the 
Reich. 

Moreover, in the present diplo- 
matic set-up the Franco-Soviet pact, 
in German eyes, still constitutes a 
real obstacle to any understanding 
either between France and Italy or 
between Germany and Britain. It 
should be ended, it is held, before 
any four-handed agreement can 
even be discussed. 

This is all puzzling to the outside 
observer. It seems to imply a diplo- 
matic disarmaraent for everybody 
except the partners in the Rome- 
Berlin axis. This would hardly be 
reasonable. 

It is, however, in accord with the 
oft-stated German expectation, 
which may be briefly outlined as 
a free hand for Britain overseas in 
return for a free hand for Germany 
on the Continent. France appar- 
ently would be expected to content 
herself with peace under those con- 
ditions. 





| real 


Carrying it further—which may | 


| Mussolini prefer: promises of part- 
' nership by Hitler, or the assurance 
(which he can get) that if ever 


| Hitler moved beyond the Brenner 


Pass, Britain would blockade Ger- 
man ports and France would use 
her army to aid Italy? 


Britain Takes the Lead 
It is apparent that Prime Min- 


‘ister Chamberlain, after his suc- 
lecess of the Anglo-Italian treaty, 


has now regained for London a 
predominant position in Old World 
politics. Along with the firm 
pledges given to France as regards 
her security from attack, Britain 


|has taken the lead and France has 


swung along with the British de- 
sires on many points, notably on 
resorting to regional agreements 
rather than depending longer on 


| the collective security idea, cen- 
| tered in the League of Nations. 


Furthermore, the British have 
made it plain to the French that 
they intend to try to reach an 
agreement with Germany. Yet, 
over and above this, there is the 
alliance of the two democracies 
and should Chamberlain succeed in 
an agreement with Hitler and even 
should there result the four-power 
pact, dear to Mussolini, it is to be 
expected that such an alignment 
would still be dominated by the 


| Anglo-French alliance. 


This is true beca there is a 
and honest community be- 
tween British and French interests 
which cannot exist between Ger- 
man and Italian interests. Disre- 
garding the fascist-versus-democ- 
racy angle of the situation, there 
will always be, from the national 
viewpoints, a greater cooperation 
between London and Paris than 
any cooperation Berlin and Rome 
could work out. 
The Case of Czechoslovakia 

When the original agenda of the 
London conversations were sug- 
gested by the British, the Centra! 
European situation, and notably 
Czechoslovakia, was left out. At 
the insistence of France this item 
was put on the program. The 
French took the position that they 
remained firm in their promises 
to protect Prague should Berlin 
attack Czechoslovakia. The British 
remained on their position stated 
Chamberlain in the Commons 
24, so far as involved 
military to 
Prague. In that speech the Prime 
Minister said Britain would give 
no definite guarartees, but warned 
that if a Central European war 
started Britain might well take a 
hand. 

But in a positive way Britain

Collective Security Issue 

From a pedantic point of view 
it may said that, in perfecting 
the alliance with Britain, France 
has gone back on the collective 
idea of the League. If 
true, then France can be 
said to be the last great power 
which up that idea. The 
Europe in which France lives*to- 
day is not a Europe which was en- 
visaged when the League, with a 
large degree of American partici- 
pation, was launched. Surely Wil- 
son never foresaw a Europe which 
would contain two great dictator- 
ships, separated from the League, 
with an axis which definitely put 
France in danger. 

Nor is it saying much to pro- 
claim that the League failed in 
this or that. The League never hed 
any existence separate from the 
countries which composed it. It is 
a piece of machinery to be used or 
to be and those who 
formed it have not used it for sert- 
Its idea of inter- 
cooperation received a 
blow when, for nationalistic 
the United States pulled 
out and from thence on the devo- 
tion of other countries cooled pro- 
gressively, for nationalistic rea 
The French cannot be ac- 
cused of heading that procession. 
What has happened is that in the 
conflict between ideology and real- 
ism the French been forced 
to a more realistic point of view. 
To blame the French peculiarly for 
that now is to show blindness to 
all the evidence. 

The Meeting in Rome 

On May 3 Hitler will start from 
3erlin for his long-announced visit 
to returning the visit 
Mussolini made to the Fuehrer last 
Fall. Rome has prepared a grandi-

France have taken momentous steps 


this week which should prove de- | 


cisive some day in checking Ger- 
many's march toward supremacy in 
Europe. 

Transformation of the entente into 
an ironclad defensive alliance is a 
historic event, which will, however, 
have fav greater importance for the 
future than for the present. Its 
immediate effects will be negligible 
unless Germany chooses to regard 
it as a warning. 

It will not by itself prevent Ger- 
many from pushing farther and 
farther down the Danube Valley 
until Nazi power touches the Black 
Sea. No alliance of Britain and 
France, no matter how strong, can 
keep Germany from dominating 
Central Europe unless the people of 
the two Western democracies are 


willing to go to war to prevent her. | 


Czechs Face Choice 

Czechoslovakia, in particular, can- 
not expect to be saved by the newly 
formed alliance or by Anglo-French 
diplomatic action soon to be taken | 
in her behalf in Berlin. The Czechs 
still face their terrifying choice of 
making peace with their gigantic 
neighbor to the north or of being 
swallowed up by him. 

But the effects of 
French alliance will be felt increas- 
ingly as Germany thrusts farther | 
into the little nations of Central 
Europe and begins to challenge the 
great powers of the West. When 
that day comes the Anglo-French 
alliance will be a rampart beyond 
which Germany may not be able 
to go. 

The combined air forces of the 
two countries already have strength 
far exceeding Germany’s. Their 
combined navies have such over- 
whelming superiority that they can 
keep the oceans clear. 
bined armies will be inferior in 
numbers but probably able to de- 
fend themselves behind the Maginot 
Line. Behind that rampart, too, 
there is not only armed strength 
but economic and financial power 
of the world’s greatest colonial em- 
pires.

By PAUL M. ATKINS 
The coming visit of Adolf Hitler | 
to Italy will give a final polish to 


the axis around which he and} 


| Benito Mussolini expect the affairs

their ally remains a question. 

Prime Minister Chamberlain has, 
in most French opinion, proved at 
jleast opportune in his negotiations 
with Premier Mussolini of Italy. 
For although their results may be 
only relative, and there are still 
many doubtful points to be cleared 
up, it certainly happened fortu- 
nately for Mussolini and every one 
else that he should appear to have 
made something like a Rome-Lon- 
don axis at the moment when the 
Rome-Berlin axis was converted 
into a Rome-Berlin frontier. 

Reports both here and from Rome 
have all been couched in optimistic 
iterms regarding the possibilities of 
ithe Franco-Italian conversations. 
What will happen, however, still 
greatly depends on what is said and 
done behind the parade with which 
Chancellor Hitler will be welcomed 
next week in Rome. At the moment 
Mussolini seems to believe he has 
much to sell and can make a good 
|bargain with whichever side he 
deals.

tacks, Czechoslovakia has been 
having all the excitement and 
trouble over its German minority. 
Hitler’s man Czechoslovakia, 
j}Konrad Henlein, leader of the

French or Russian air fleets.

It does not require a microscopic | 
examination, however, to reveal 
flaws in this axis, flaws which may 
well cause it to bend and even to 
break as time goes on: The recent |

major cause of these de- 
fects, but it has served to make 
them more evident and has has- 
tened the time when they will be 
felt. 

Hitler and Mussolini have eoop- 
erated to a greater or less extent in 
the past because it has been totheir | 
mutual interest to do so. There ape, 
however, certain fundamental con- 
flicts of interest between their two 
countries which cannot be over- 
looked. 

Highly important in this connec- 
tion is the fact that Italy and Ger- 
many are economic rivals in Cen- 
tral and Southeastern Europe. Both 
need markets which can be domi- 
nated if not controlled. Such an 
opportunity is offered by Hungary, 
Rumania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and 
Greece. 

Value as a Market 

These countries have a combined 
population in excess of 50,000,000. 
Their average purchasing power is 
admittedly small, especially in the 
case of manufactured goods, but 
their total consuming capacity is 
sufficiently large to be of real sig- 
nificance to both Italy and Ger- 
many. If either nation could get 
the control of the markets of any 
or all of these countries by treaty 
by other means, its own eco- 
nomic position would be strength- 
ened. 

The countries of Central and 
Southeastern Europe also produce 
many of the foodstuffs and raw! 
materials which are essential to 
Germany and Italy. Although Italy 
has exerted the most strenuous ef- 
forts to make herself self-sufficient 
in respect to wheat, a bad crop 
would force her to import heavily 
of this grain. Germany, although 
she has cut her grain im- 
ports in recent years, must remain

At the time the Russians 
had about twenty times as many 
military planes as Germany. Czecho- 
slovakia had also just signed the 
Czecho-Soviet Pact, simultaneously 
with the French signing the Franco- 
Soviet Pact. Goering sent for the 
air and industrial. maps of Europe, 
and pored over them, 

“They could blow our industry 
out of the ground,” he said. ‘‘Black 
out the Chemnitz section tomorrow 
night and send a squadron over it.”’ 

The blacking out did no good. The 


| squadron picked out the massive in- 


dustries without trouble 
artificial clouds did not help much. 
Moreover, the airmen reported the 
distances were so short and the ob- 
jectives so big that an enemy bomb- 
ing-fleet flying by dead-reckoning 
from the near-by Czech airports 
could not miss. 

Goering speeded up the building 
of his air force and began a drive 
in favor of Germany among the 
Sudeten Germans in Czechoslo- 
vakia.

Rumania and Yugoslavia are noted 
for their grain exports. 

Perhaps more important to both 
Italy and Germany is an adequate | 


|'source of supply of meats—cattle, 
| hogs and poultry. There is no pres- 


ent reason to suppose that either 
of these countries is likely to be- 
come self-supporting in so far as 
this type of food is concerned. 
Hungary, Rumania and Yugoslavia 
are in a position to furnish meats 
in large quantities. 


| Source ef Raw Material 


Southeastern Europe can also| 
supply a variety of raw materials, 
including minerals and wood prod- 
ucts. Of these undoubtedly the 
most important is petroleum, vitally 
necessary for both industrial and 
operations. Rumania has 
important reserves of oil, and, 
while the output in recent years 
has not been large, it could be in- 
creased substantially if it appeared 
desirable or necessary. 

One great attraction of Central 
and Southeastern Europe to Italy 
and Germany, both as a source of 
supply and as a market for their 
products, is that the two countries 
cannot be cut off from this area by 
a sea power, In the event of a war 
in which Great Britain would be 
opposed to either of them this fac- 
tor would be of outstanding im- 
portance, 

With both nations feeling the need 
for economic dominance in this sec- 
tion of Europe, there are reasons 
for believing that the struggle be- 
tween them for control is going to 
be keen and that it will be increas- 
ingly difficult for Hitler and Musso- 
lini to reconcile their ambitions in 
this quarter. 

In this probable competition, Ger- 
many—especially now that Austria 
has been annexed—has certain def- 
inite advantages. Vienna for many 
years was the banking and commer- 
cial focus for much of this territory. 
This was due not alone to the fact 
that this city was the political cap- 
ital of the old Austro-Hungarian 
Empire, There were sound, basic 
| reasons for its location and growth. 


Vienna’s Situation 


Vienna is situated on the Danube 
River, where the north and south 
and the east and west trade routes 
cross. Not only is the river a con- 
venient means of transportation for 
bulky and heavy goods, but the 
whole river system provides easy 
access to the region southeast of 
the city. Even if a river cannot be 
used for water transport, its valley 
usually facilitates the construction 
of railroad lines. 

Germany, therefore, has relatively 
| easy means of reaching the desired 
markets and sources of supply, 
whereas Italy is cut off from them 

| by mountain ranges. 
Moreover, it is usually easier to 
|renew old business ties than it is 
|to establish new ones. Although 
many of the banking and commer- 
cial relations of Vienna with the 
Danube countries were severed with 
the break-up of the Austro-Hun- 
garian Empire, the old connections 
|}can in many instances be regained 
without serious difficulty. 

What has been pointed out as to 


military 


| the economic rivalry between Italy| countries, as in the days of the! 


and Germany in Central and South- 


| of Spanish territory in due course, 
;but Germany has not assumed any 
|like obligation. 


If Germany fails to 
remove her troops and gains eco- 
nomic advantages, whether they re- 
sult from this or not, Italy is cer- 


| tainly going to be discontented. 


Conflict of interest in the econom- | 
ic sphere is not the only source of | 


| disagreement between Hitler and| 


Mussolini. There are also political | 
causes of discord. Now that Ger-; 
many is at the Brenner Pass, how 
long is* Hitler going‘to be willing | 
to leave in Italian hands a quarter | 
of a million Germans who live just | 
south of this pass? He cannot do it | 
indefinitely without prejudicing his | 
position at home. 

For years Trieste was the princi- 
pal commercial port of the Austro- 
Hungarian Empire, and since the 
World War, it has served not only 


Italy but also Austria and, to a house and are firmly determined to/reagonable young man. 


certain extent, Czechoslovakia and 
South Germany. Now that Austria 
is a part of Germany, is Hitler go- 
ing to be willing to have the port 
which can conveniently serve the 
whole southern part of his empire! 
controlled by a foreign country, 
even an ally? 


Factor of Inferiority 


Traditions may mean little in the 
United States, but they frequently 
count heavily in Europe. It is re-| 
ported that one of the reasons why | 
Mussolini was so eager to negotiate 
the treaty so recently arranged | 
with Great Britain was because it} 
placed Italy on full diplomatic) 
parity with Britain. For years | 
Italians had an inferiority complex 
in regard to Great Britain. The 
British fleet dominated the Medi- 
terranean Sea and so was in a po- 
sition to control Italy. Under the! 
new treaty, British control of this 
sea is shared with Italy. 


In a similar fashion, Italians had | 
a sense of inferiority in respect to | 
Germany. It came largely from the | 
fact that, for generations, the Aus- 
trians ruled large sections of Italy. | 
Now that Germany with a popula- 
tion of some 73,000,000 is on the 
border of Italy with its 43,000,000, | 
the Italians are feeling more keen- | 
ly the inferior position in which | 
their country is placed in relation | 
to Germany. 

Mussolini cannot help but realize | 
that, in addition to a much larger | 
population, Germany possesses cer- | 
tain natural advantages—an ade- 


‘quate supply of coal, some iron ore 


and other minerals, etc.—which 
Italy does not have. Moreover, the | 
German industrial, commercial and 
banking organizations are larger. 


Long-Time Effects | 


The factors just outlined are not | 
the only ones that will affect the | 
relations etween Hitler and Mus- | 
solini. Each still has need of the} 
other and it may be some time yet | 
before the forces which have been | 
described begin to make their ef- 
fects visible. But whether they re- 
main under cover or not, the forces 
continue to exist. In the long run, 
if past history is a sound basis for 
judgment, they will cause the paths | 
of Hitler and Mussolini eventually 
to diverge, and may. well lead their 


World War, into opposite camps.

Czech Reaction Varies 

Among Czechs the comment one 
hears varies from malicious satis- 
faction at the self-revelation to in- 
dignation at the extent of the de- 
mands. In political and semi-offi- 
cial circles the former sentiment is 
mingled with grave concern as to 
what such a complete dropping of 
the mask of years can portend, for 
it is obvious that this change of 
front would not have been made 
without assurance of strong back- 
ing from Germany. 

The effect of the speech on Czechs 
in the street has been predominant- 


ly to produce indignation and deep | 


resentment. This stubborn people 
is not one to be alarmed by threats 
or impressed by the stagecraft of 
totalitarian movements. The dan- 
ger threatening from the Sudeten 
German areas and beyond has noth- 
ing but a hardening effect on the 
Czech resolution not to be deprived 
of the liberty won after centuries 


lof oppression, or at least of sub- | or 


jugation to others’ wills. 
Under the new threat Czechs pre- 


where French, Italians or even Aus- 


| trians might have crowded into the |the characteristics

is little that is volatile about this 
tough, dogged people. 


Voice of Command 

The man in the street believes 
that understanding was not the ob- 
ject of Herr Henlein’s speech. He 
heard himself talked to in accents 
he had not heard since the domina- 


| tion of imperial Austria came to an | 
| end in 1918, and rarely even before | 
| that. The memories aroused were} 


not pleasant. 

He heard the voice of a race 
claiming to have been born to com- 
mand addressing a race it regards 
as born to obey. The Czechs know 
the tone. They don’t like it. 


For twenty years now the Czechs | 


have been masters in their own 
remain so. They are prepared to 
fight—supported or not—in defense 
of their freedom. And if this or any 
other government were to show 
signs of giving way on essentials, it

| The government’s determination 
is beyond question to establish abso-

public, even though’ these efforts 
may be summarily rejected without 
knowledge of their nature, as the 
Sudeten Germans are doing with 
the proposed nationality statute 
But hopes of practical results in 
establishing even tolerable relations

and expressed fears—fears that |

tionary at a time when all signs | 
indicate that Britain is in for at 
least a leveling-off of the lines of 
prosperity if not a descent or nose- 
dive. 

But those who have been loudest 
in their condemnation of the gOv- 
ernment found in the budget the 
first thing that they could approve 
for many months. Perhaps it was a 
hangover of the old Liberal Glad- 
Sstonian tradition of ‘‘pay as you 
go,”" but Liberal spokesmen gener- 


ally backed up the budget of the | 


National Government. 

Indeed, most of the criticisms of 
the size of the new taxes is based 
mainly on Sir John’s timing, this 
being held bad in view of the pres- 
ent economic situation. 


Unpopularity Inevitable 


No matter how much Britain rec- 
ognizes a necessity for rearmament 
it is obviously platitudinous to say 
that this budget is violently unpop- 
ular. It is therefore especially in- 
teresting to note that it was pro- 
mulgated in the face of a by-elec- 
tion in Lichfield, Staffordshire, on 
May 5, when once more the entire 
Chamberlain policy will be tested

HIS IDEAS 


NORTH AND SOUTH AIDED 


By HUGH SMITH 
Wireless to Toe New York Trmers, 
DUBLIN, April 30.-The Anglo- 


Trish Relations Treaty which Pre- | 


;mier Eamon de Valera signed in 
| London this week carries a signifi- 
|eance which the mere reading of 
the text does not disclose. The

jnational pride caused by occupa- 
jtion of ports, in the settiement of 
{the financial dispute over land an- 
nuities and the _ restoration of 
amicable trade relations; of much 
greater moment than these tangible 
things is the creation of a real 
jspirit of friendship and mutual 
trust between the two peoples. 





It is one of the paradoxes of Mr. | 


de Valera’s remarkable career that 
a man who has been so busy dur- 
ing the past five years abolishing 
the oath of allegiance, removing 
the Governor General acting in the 
name of the King from the’ coun- 
try’s internal constitutional affairs 
and getting rid of every trace of 
Britis! dominion in the twenty-six 
counties should have drawn the 
peoples o1 the two countries closer 
together than ever before. 


The Treaty of 1921 

The Anglo-Irish treaty negotiated 
by Michael Collins and Arthur Grif- 
fith in 1921 ended active warfare 
between the two islands, but never 
gave Britain that tide of good-will

next few years to garner some of 
the benefits which the other Do-

Not only has this pact reversed 
Mr. de Valera’s agricultural policy 
but it also has effectively dispelled 
the unattainable insular dream of 
a self-sufficient Ireland. Defending 
the trade terms of the pact in the 
Dail Mr. de Valera told the House 
that there must be an element of 
give and take. He has learned the 
lesson that one cannot expect to 
sell over 90 per cent of the coun- 
try’s agricultural exports to Brit- 
ain without making reciprocal pur-

SOVIET PRESSURE 


Moscow Opens New Drive to 
Curb Churches, Flourishing 
After Twenty Years

[YOUTHS AMONG FAITHFUL 


By HAROLD DENNY 
Wireless to Tus New Yore Times. 

MOSCOW, April 30.—The arrests 
of clergymen and their followers in 
| the past year, culminating in the 
j}announcement last Sunday (the 
| Russian Easter) of the arrest of at 
| least twenty-five religious practi- 
tloners on treason charges, focused 
}attention once more on the status 
| of religion in the Soviet Union 

It would be hard to find a parallel 
In modern times for the persecution 
| that the church has had to endure 
since the Bolsheviki, avowed ene- 
mies of all religion, came to power 
twenty years ago. Yet one finds 
religion still holding on with a 
tenacity that is simply amazing. 

It is hoiding on and carrying on, 
for an astonishing number of young 
| persons, who theoretically should 

have been won away long ago by 
jthe interminable and ubiquitous 
| Soviet propaganda against religion, 
attend church, as was strikingly 
evidenced by the congregations at 
the Easter Eve ceremonies jamming 
and overflowing every Greek Or- 
thodox Church in Moscow. 

This unexpected stubbornness of 
religion and the fact that religion, 
instead of dying out with the be- 
lievers left over from Czarist times, 
is being carried forward in the new 
generation are factors In the re 
vival of anti-religious activities.

from a political point of view it

It is most doubtful if Mr. Cham-

against Cabinet Ministers partici- 
pating in the campaign will count- 
eract the effect of the budget pro- 
posals—even though in raising the 
ban Mr, Chamberlain exempted im- 
portant Ministers such as the Chan- 
cellor of the Exchequer, so that Sir 
John will not be there. Indeed right

this line is pure speculation, it 
was certainly not an electioneering 
budget that the Commons heard 
Tuesday. 

Leaving out the effect of the in- 


come-tax increases, Sir John raised | 
the tea levy by twopence, and it is | 


traditional that this form of tax on 
one of the great necessities of 
English life, and the one most en- 
joyed by the working classes, is po- 
litical dynamite. 


Munitions Profits 

Another feature which is bound 
to cause bitter criticism is the fact 
that outside of the efforts to catch 
tax dodgers Sir John made no 
attempt to limit the profits on the 
munitions that the new taxes will 
buy and gave the higher income 
brackets the same treatment as 
those in the middle. Indeed, he 
allowed increased exemptions for 
wear and tear on plants and 
machinery. 

The lower brackets—by the Eng- 
lish definition at least, though 
these are well below what are so 
regarded in the United States— 
came off best of all, for the new 
income tax does not operate until 
a taxable income of £135 has been 
reached. 

Likewise Sir John did not touch 
the surtax, so that the new burden, 
as far as income tax is concerned, 
comes directly and brutally on 
some 2,000,000 middle-class tax- 
payers, who are now finding them- 
selves paying more than at any 
period in British history except 
immediately after the war, 

There is one special group that is 


|also due to howl over the budget— 


the motorists, who are now paying 
through the nose for gasoline while 
hundreds of thousands of cyclists

free of taxes,

By ELIOT JANEWAY 


In trade reports from Tokyo there | 
are new indications of that Japa- | 
nese economic crisis which has been 
predicted since the Japanese Army 
|}set out on its great campaign in 
China. It is now clear that Japan 


| has failed to carry through her plan 


of holding down non-military im- 
ports; a heavier drain is thus being 
|placed on her diminished gold re- 


serve which cannot last indefinitely. | | 


The alternatives left for her if and | 
when the gold reserve is exhausted 
are peace and, failing that, foreign 
credits. 

During the fizsst two months of 
1938 Japan successfully completed 
a major part of her economic pro- 
gram. Her trade deficit was re- 
duced by three-quarters from the 
dangerously high level which it had 


reached in the first two months of | 
19387. With this apparent return to} 


financial orthodoxy, however, went 
continued deterioration in Japan's | 
|export trade, which ijost one-fifth in 
| value as compared with the corre- 
sponding period of 1937. 
|A Wartime Necessity 

The scaling down of the trade 
deficit had to be effected in order 


to permit the authorities to con-/| 


tinue to buy abroad the essential 
supplies required for the conduct of 
the war. It was made possible by 
the stringent quotas which were 
imposed upon the import of hun- 
dreds of commercial articles. 
Thanks to these quotas, imports 
were cut at twice the rate that ex- 
ports fell. 

The difficulty which soon arose, 

| however, was that non-military im- 
[ports were cut too drastically. 
| Originally imports were limited be- | 
}cause exports were declining. But 
the import quotas chiefly affected 
raw materials like cotton and wool 
which, when worked up by Japa- 
nese industry, accounted for the 
| better part of Japan's export reve- 
| nues. These industries were forced 
| to shut down for lack of raw mate- 
rials. 

By March Japan’s ambitious pro- 
gram of import curtailment had 
collapsed. During the last two 
months she has been compelled to 
return to the international commod- 
ity markets in quest of virtually 
every commercial raw material 
which she had proposed to do with- 


out. 
Imports of Cotton 

Foremost among the materials 
discriminated against had been cot- 
ton, Japan’s leading import, and, 
| processed into textiles, her leading 


source of export revenue as well. 
| Because of the rising cost of the | 


'“Ohina incident’ the authorities 
ordered a 30 per cent reduction in 
cotton imports last September and 
in December they compelled the re- 
calcitrant textile manufacturers to 
agree to a further limitation of 30 
per cent upon their raw material 
imports. In spite of all attempts to 
substitute synthetic cotton goods 
for the natural product in order to 
conserve all available cotton for ex- 
port, in spite also of the substitu- | 
tion of native silk for imported | 

| eotton in a good part of the domes- 
tie market, the decline In cotton 


® 


‘Her Need to Restore 


Some Imports Puts 
A Drain on Gold 


imports severely injured the mills 
producing goods for the export mar- 
ket. 

At the end of February, 1937, 
| Japan’s warehouses held 492,000 
bales of raw cotton, and in May 
nearly twice that amount. At the 
end of last February, after less 
than six months of import restric- 
tions, the national supply on hand 
had fallen to less than 98,000 bales. 
From September, when the crop 
year begins, to the end of February 
Japan’s 1937-38 cotton purchases 
came to only 28 per cent of the pre- 
vious year's total. 

By April 1, the cotton shortage 
had become desperate. And so, in 
spite of the powerful consideration 
that the decline in cotton imports 
|accounted for all but 7,000,000 of 


| the 187,000,000-yen decline in the 


January-February import bill, 
| March saw the rate of Japan’s cot- 
ton imports recover to half the vol- 
|ume of March, 1937. And although 
the Japanese Department of Com- 
merce and Industry is determined 
to stabilize cotton imports slightly 
below the (unsatisfactory) March 
level, Japan’s April purchases in 
the United States have run well 
ahead of their 1937 volume and 
compare favorably with the still 
higher level of April, 1936, 


Further Restrictions? 
| If imports are to be kept within 
the quota, further restrictions will 
be necessary. Likewise, larger cash 
| payments than the authorities had 
budgeted for will be unavoidable. 
Japan's wool supply presents fur- 
ther difficulty to the War Cabinet, 
jand it also complicates her rela- 
|tions with Australia. Japan had 
| obligated herself to buy 800,000 bales 
| of Australian wool between Janu- 
ary, 1937, and June, 1938, but to 
date it is doubtful whether she has 
j}taken half of this amount. While 
| wool prices were collapsing at the 
turn of the year, Japan stayed out 
of the wool market. Not until early 
|in April did she resume her pur- 
chases and then import permits for 
only 45,000 bales were granted, rot 
| all of the bales to come from Austra- 
|lia. Though the government has 
|not indicated how many weeks it 
expects 45,000 bales to last the 
harassed woolen section of the tex- 
tile industry, it is certain that fur- 
|ther import licenses will shortly 
have to be granted. 


| Trouble With Australia 
Meanwhile, Japan's failure to buy 

up to her quota of Australian wool 

has not added to her chance of 


persuading the Australian authori- | 


ties to revoke their recent decision 
prohibiting exports of iron ore. 
Japanese interests had secured a 
handsome concession, but exports 
were banned by the Australian Gov- 
ernment on the grounds that such 
deposits might only be exploited in 
the interests of national! defense.

Reason for Quotas

for Japan to finance her imports |

the South

church schools are forbidden. 

But in actual practice the Soviet 
regime can close any church it 
wishes and can do so with perfect 
legality. The grounds on which 
churches may be closed include the 
following, according to a recent au- 
thoritative Soviet interpretation: 

“Houses of worship are closed 
and liquidated by intercession of 
the overwhelming majority of the 
population if the building is essen- 
‘tial for the State and cocial needs 
* * © if the building is dilapidated 
and a special commission declares 
that it shal! be torn down.” 


| Building Hits Churches 

Widening of streets in the pro- 
gram of enlarging and modernizing 
Moscow building of subway 
stations have caused the destruc- 
tion of many of the churches that 
gave Moscow its extraordinary 
other-world flavor. 

The recent arrests of religious 
| practitioners have been based on 
| ostensible plotting of religious com- 
municants against the Soviet State 
|—which is treason. And the trea- 
ison sections of the Soviet criminal 
| code are broad and loose. 

The arrests of the past year and 
|many before them have been on 
|such familiar charges as sabotage 
‘and espionage in behalf of foreign 
/ Secret services, including Germany 
‘and Japan. It can be readily be- 
lieved that the church in Russia 
;contains a higher proportion of 
| members displeased with the Soviet 
| regime than any other group, but 
}as no evidence in any of these re- 
lligious “treason cases’ has been 
|made public it is impossible even 
to guess at their validity.

All that has its significance. It

is concerned that the Rebel offen-

j}ended with the drive to the coast. 
The one fundamental thing the In-

—destroy the Republican army— 
they have conspicuously failed to 
do. They split it in two, scattered 
parts of it, drove other parts back, 
but the army is still there and still 
to be reckoned with.

it is better to count on the worst

So, all in all, it means something 
that one can go out to the Ebro 
front as we did today and find 
nothing to do but stroll around in 
the Spring sunshine and eat an ex- 
cellent lunch with one of the two 
remaining old-timers among the 
great International Brigade com- 
manders. We had hors d’oeuvres, 
Spanish omelet, rabbit stew with 
potatoes, cheese and coffee and the 
excellent spicy wine of the region 
to wash it all down. And then we 
sat under an olive tree and talked 
of Madrid and Guadalajara and, 
above all, of Washington and 
whether the Neutrality Act is really 
going to be amended so that Spain 
can buy planes and other material. 

The Spaniards ith us talked of 
Guernica, for this is the anniver-

Indeed 
the brim with a strange 
di of herbs, flesh and spices, right 
here at the time when the first 
real spark is to be lighted under It 
by next Tuesday's primary election 
Florida. 

From the way the vapor blows 
that day the country may know the 
direction of the wind a bit better 
than it knows it now, for in the 
Democratic primary race in Florida 
Senator Claude Pepper, an ardent 
New Deal supporter, is being 
fought for his seat by Representa- 
ive Mark Wilcox and former Gov- 
ernor Dave Sholtz. 

Any immediate attempt to simpli- 
fy the present politica! situation in 
the United States would be truly 
hazardous. the Florida pri- 
mary, and another equally impor- 
tant one which will follow during 
the same month in Pennsylvania, 
should not be taken as conclusive, 
however they might go. Many qual- 
ifications will have to be made in 
fitting them into a national pat- 
tern. 

Basic Issue Complicated 

The basic issue itself is compli- 
eated in the coming campaign. 
Fundamentally it is the same as it 
in 1936 and in 1934—Roose 
There are such variations to 
it now, however, as could readily 
cause enough election upsets to 
completely shift the control of both 
houses of Congress—not to an oppo 
site party, of course, but to an op- 
position which would be more dis- 
astrous to Mr. Roosevelt's immedi- 
ate purposes. 

The issue is no 
‘Roosevelt, fur ‘im or agin ’im.” 
Hitherto reliable indices, including 
polls, correspondence in newspaper 
letter columns and even votes in 
Congress, have indicated a grow- 
ing tendency among the voters to 
discriminate between Roosevelt per- 
sonality and Roosevelt method. 

The man and the measures will 
doubtless be tried separately in 
many a State and Congressional 
district during the next six months. 
A further confusing element cen- 
tering around Mr. Roosevelt is the 
question of his own personal polit- 
ical intention in relation to the 
Presidential election in 1940. 
Strange as it may seem, the lack 
of definite information on this score 
is a large part of the motivation 
behind both the Philip La Follette 
third-party movement in Wisconsin 
and the old-line Democratic re- 
surgence in the South. 


Old Yardsticks Inadequate 
In this set of circumstances the 
old rules for political calculation 
are entirely inadequate. One can- 
not take the form sheets and set 
down former Republican districts 
here, close races there, and fight- 
ing margins at other places and 
arrive at anything like a fair esti- 
mate of what is likely to happen. 
Whatever the Republican gains 
in Congress, now estimated roughly 
at a maximum of four in the Sen- 
ate and sixty in the House, they 
will not be ‘‘positive’’ additions to 
the titular opposition, but rather 
losses to the Democrats. They will 
be gained not primarily through 
favor for any program the Repub- 
licans offer but through disfavor 
among the voters for Roosevelt 
policies and, most of all, as a reac- 
tion to the new business recession. 
A thing that renders the old po- 
litical yardsticks even more obso- 
lete are the struggles going on 
among the President’s own former

has heard during 
davs that the Presi-

seeking to minimize its importance. 
Still another story—the air has been

Regardless of the ultimate results 
of the Philip La Follette plans, the

NEW DEAL IN THE HANDSHAKE 


Mrs. Roosevelt Introduces Planned Economy 


To Political Washington’s Busy Industry 


By DELBERT CLARK 

WASHINGTON, April 30. — Like 
many another custom of Republi- 
can days, now all but forgotten, 
the political handshake under the 
New Deal has undergone a met- 
amorphosis, and when glad-handers 
of the old school] read this week an 
account of Mrs. Roosevelt’s frank 
remarks on the planned economy of 
greeting she habitually practices, 
there was a deal of portentous wag- 
ging of the head. For to be thus 
candid about one of the primary 
tricks of the trade was not pre-

So far as the White House itself, 
is concerned the business of shaking | 
hands has dwindled a great deal. | 
Formerly on New Year's morning 
thousands of humble citizens filed 
slowly through the mansion, solemn- 
ly clasping the hand of their ruler |

But no President enjoyed it and 
Mr. Roosevelt made a virtue of 
physical necessity and quietly aban- | 
doned the practice, winning the 
eternal gratitude of Presidents yet 
unborn. 

New Dealers in general, as a mat- 
ter of fact, do much less handshak- } 
ing than their predecessors in the} 
executive branch, having more on| 
their minds, perhaps, than the po-| 


‘litical value of a clasped hand. ined

ley (his chances to wear the Roose- 
velt mantle in 1940 should the Pres- 
ident not ‘‘choose’’ to run again is 
threatened in his own Senatorial 
primary in Kentucky); Earle (his 
future depends greatly on what 
| happens to him in the Senatorial 
primary in Pennsylvania on May 
17), and numerous others. 

Meanwhile, too, the country will 
witness another attempt of a Pres- 
ident to maintain specific control 
over Congress through resort to 
his general popularity with the peo- 
ple, not wholly unlike the effort of 
former President Wilson during the 
crisis of the World War.

female, adult and juvenile, and she 
has reduced 
necessary chore to its skeletal 
structure without appreciably di- 
minishing its apparent cordiality. 
When a long line of Daughters of 
the American Revolution or Sons 
and Daughters of the Wheel With- 
in a Wheel approaches her, she 
grasps each by the fingers, gently 
but firmly, before he has a chance 
to do any grasping himself, and 
pulls him graciously past while 
smiling and saying something pleas- 
ant and innocuous. 


Routine Is Modulated 


| Thus, she says, she keeps the line 
| moving as rapidly as possible, dis- 
| courages pauses for inane conver- 
sation, saves her own hand from 
excessive bruising and makes 
| everybody happy. This routine, 
| modulated to fit the particular cir- 
cumstances, she follows on all hand- 
shaking occasions, and no one who 
realizes that she probably shakes 
more hands per annum than her 
distinguished husband can blame 
her for putting a little efficiency 
into an ancient rite. 

President Hoover might well have 
profited by her example, had he 
had it before him. Mr. Hoover, a 
notoriously shy man, painfully en- 
dured the firm clasp of millions of 
hands during his four years as 
President, and he never seemed to 
be able to simplify the process. On 
one occasion, when an unusually 
large crowd attended a reception

NATIONAL SPARK PLUG CHANGE 
WEEK MAY 2nd to 8th 


Go places this Spring, the most enjoyable motor- 
ing season, with an engine that’s as full of 
youthful vitality as the spirit of the season itself. 


Replace those mileage-worn, winter-weary spark 
plugs which time and strenuous service have 


robbed of efficiency, 


with new Champions. You 


will experience a surge of new power, faster 
acceleration and better, smoother performance 
which Champions bring to every engine. 


Champion Spark Plug Change Week has be- 
come the accepted period for bringing cars up 
to peak performance by millions of the nation’s 
motorists. Regularly at this time or every 10,000 
miles, they have their Champion dealer check 
their spark plugs. When new spark plugs are 
necessary, from an economy and efficiency stand- 
point, they demand ee because they 


appreciate the sustained 


and the gas-saving 
alone provide. 


See your car 
dealer, garage 
man, or service 
Station man this 
week and have 
him check and 
clean your spark 
plugs. Ifyouneed 
new ones, insist 
on Champions 

you can

WASHINGTON, April 30. — In 


hundreds of filing cases and desks | 
of Washington officialdom lies the | 
evidence of a new American indoor | 
“to end | 


sport—evolution of plans 
the depression.”’ 

The submission of such plans by 
uniderttified citizens reached fair 
proportions in the years 1933 to 
1935, but the mass of them which 
poured into Washington at that 
time apparently has been dwarfed 
by the new barrage, which began 
to arrive as soon as the recession 
started last Fall. 

They come daily from every- 
where and from all types of per- 
sons, largely to the White House, 
but in great quantities to every 
Cabinet member and the agency 
heads connected with recovery or 
relief work; to officials whose 
names have received 


to Senators and Representatives. 
Fate of Letters 

Most of them are acknowledged, 
many of them are read and a few 
are discussed. And then they are 
filed. Often segments of them figure 
in conferences or, speeches, and 
that is the only reward most of the 
authors ask,

tively to write to Washington about 
their problems, 

The invitation released the flood.

note for the favorite political speech 
which characterizes most cam- 
paigns: greater benefits for the pub- 
lic and less cost to the taxpayer. 

It has been seriously urged in 
countless letters, and as seriously 
discussed by some presumably in- 
telligent people, that one way to re- 
store prosperity would be for the 
government to declare a moratori- 
um on taxes for two or three years, 
with the arrears to be paid in later 
years without interest charges. No 
means is suggested by which gov- 
ernment could operate in the non- 
income period. 

Then there is a very large group 
of amateur economists—and some 
| professional ones, too—who believe 
the government should spend at a 
rate which would make previous 
efforts seem those of a piker, piling 
up the debt and laying on taxes 
until business would be generally 
covereu into the cloak of govern- 
ment operation. 

One of the most popular sugges- 
tions is that the government take 
over and operate all utilities and 
public service businesses. In letters 
of this type little note usually 
taken of the fact that there are 
definite constitutional requirements 
that the properties be paid for by 
the government, 


The Velocity Theory 

Perhaps the greatest breeder of 
ideas has been the economic theory, 
widely publicized and explained in 
as Many ways as there are mone- 
tary theories, sometimes called 
“the velocity of money,” based on 
the belief that the faster money 
|moves the more credit it creates 
|and the more wealth is generated. 
| This was the basis of the Townsend 
|Plan, and it had a large place in 
Huey P. Long's doctrine. 
| Therefore, hundreds if not thou- 
sands of plans have been sent to 
| Washington urging that the gov- 
jernment really start recovery off 
with a bang by paying certain 
specified sums each month or year 
to groups of individuals, 

The more generous-minded sug- 

gest that something be paid to 
everybody. And then, with every- 
body getting a good income, and 
| spending it, the money, it is held, 
|would go round and round and 
| prosperity would come out every- 
| where. 
Among the suggestions, too, are 
| always a goodly number urging the 
printing of more money. It is 
argued by these economics students 
that government bonds and money 
alike are government obligations, 
that each is simply a promise to 
pay. Why not, therefore, they ask, 
finance government operations by 
dollar bills which bear no interest 
instead of by bonds on which in- 
terest must be paid? 


Public-Works Proposals 

Of course, there are suggestions 
for every sort of public works,

usually is expected to finance by

same time it is suggested also that 
further steps be taken to cope with 
those who may be tempted to mix 
relief and politics. 
TVA Act Recalled 

It has been proposed that Con- 
gress adopt an act similar to the 
provision written into the Ten- 
nessee Valley Authority Act under 
which any one in that organization 
would be summarily removed for 
using politics in connection with 
the appointment or promotion of 


officials.

Such a provision, it is maintained, 
would put an important weapon 
into the hands of the WPA and the 
PWA authorities and help them to 
defend their administrations and to 
“‘keep politics out of relief.’ 


tion frequently held forth at length 
on political and economic questions 
in the plush parlors of American 
homes or, more congenially, while 
seated on wintry Saturday after- 
noons around a red-hot stove in the 
village general store. 


Wide Variety of Plans 

Now the same ideas, brought up 
to date, are committed to paper 
and sent to Washington. They 
cover the widest conceivable range, 
and sometimes it is a little difficult 
to sort the ridiculous from the prac- 
tical‘ in times which have seen most 
of the monetary and economic the- 
ories of ten years ago controverted 
by official plans and action. 


The individual plans sent to Wash- 
ington never are made public, on 
the ground that they are personal 
and private communications. Out- 
siders are not permitted even to 
look over specimens of the White 
House mail, and most Congress 
members guard as jealously their 
correspondence. But the general 
contents of the mail are common 
knowledge. 

In the current crop of voluntary 
plans there is an ever-recurring 
idea that something can be created 
out of nothing, and that in the end 
all things will work themselves out 
all right. 

The correspondence gives the key- 


the basis of sound studies, that the 
‘fabulously wealthy’’ have been re- 
duced to a handful from which 
not enough could be ‘‘soaked.”’ 


On the income side of suggestions | 


are the usua! old stand-bys, includ- 
| ing the single-taxers and the sales- 
jtaxers, who would expand such 
taxes to cover everything except, of 
course, the things the average citi- 
zen must buy—which necessarily 
spoils any such plan. 

There are many proposals for a 
national lottery. Indications now 
are that such a plan will not 
be tried for a long time to come— 
if indeed ever. But who knows? 
At no period in national govern- 
ment, or the evolution of political 
ideas, has there been so much truth 
in the saying that ‘“‘today’s radi- 
‘cal is tomorrow's conservative.”

But the President does frequently 
dip into this correspondence from 
the public. He calls for half a 


dgzen or so of the bundles, cuts the | 


cords around them and, for a little 
while, fingers through them. He 
reads notes on bond stationery and 
penciled letters scribbled on dime 
tablets. And after an hour of such 
perusal he may have a better idea 
of the cross-section of American 
thought than he can gain in a day 
of conferences with sifted and care- 
fully assorted callers. 

It is the same to a lesser degree 
with members of Congress, who 
have less mail but who have more 
time to pay attention to it. 


NEW LEGISLATION 


| The President, in His Special Message, Asks 
_ For a New Approach to a Problem That 
Has Been Before Congress for Years 


——— 


By CHARLES W. HURD 


| WASHINGTON, April 30.—Presi- 
|dent Roosevelt's most recent mes- 
| sage to Congress, suggesting an all- 
|embracing study of the monopoly 
| question, represents a new approach 
to a problem as old as the actiwities 
;of commerce and industry. 

His goal, which he hopes to reach 
after ca,eful surveys conducted in 
deliberate manner, is the same one 
that has been recognized in the 
Common Law of England and the 
| United States for at least 500 years, 
and which was codified to a large 
| degree in three anti-trust acts in 
the Federal statutes—the presetva- 
tion of free enterprise unhampered 
by monopolistic controls which 
arbitrarily fix prices and. eonduct 
unfair competition. 

‘A Warning Conveyed 

The President’s proposals—they 
lwere so explicit and detailed that 
they required a 4,000-word message 
to state them—consisted primarily 
of suggestions for fact-finding in- 
vestigations, but in their essence 
they carried an easily read warn- 
ing that if business itself cannot 
maintain free competition it must 
face the threat of government con- 
trol to the extent necessary to pro- 
|tect this condition. 

The message was generally well 
received. Among those approving 
it was the most prominent ‘‘anti- 
'trust’’ advocate in Congress, Sena- 
tor Borah, but the Idahoan ex- 
pressed the hope that the investi- 
gations would not go so far and be- 
come so involved that their results 
would be marked only by a set of 
dusty reports reposing on a shelf. 

But the message sought to do pre- 
cisely what Senator Borah advo- 
cates—to convince the public that 
there is great danger from monop- 
oly so that the weapons now in 
existence to fight it may be used 
to their fullest extent and, if neces- 
sary, supplemented by whatever 
legislation may be requisite. 
Public as Basic Factor 

All that can be done by legisla- 
tion, Senator Borah told this corre- 
spondent, is to create new avenues 
to approach the monopoly problem. 
The basic factor in the fight, he 
emphasized, is the arousing of a 
now somnolent public attitude. 

Since the President's message in- 
volved a long-term study, with 
llittle or no immediate legislation 


| 


except a request for tightening of 
leontrol over bank holding com- 
panies, probably a year will elapse 
before another Congress actually 
grapples with legisistion. 

The first Federai ‘‘anti-trust”’ law, 
known as the Sherman Act, was 
passed by Congress in 1890, as a 
result of popular opinion that the 
common law did not offer suf- 
ficient protection to the public in 
a time of rapid industrial expan- 
sion. 

The Sherman Act declared that 
“every contract, combination in the 
form of trust or otherwise, or con- 
spiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, 
or with foreign nations’’ is Illegal 
It provided heavy penalties for all 
who participated in any action to 
| monopolize commerce and permit- 
'ted the recovery of treble damages 
by those injured through violation 
of the law. 

This act still stands as the basic 
“anti-trust law,”’ but by a decision 
of the Supreme Court in the Stand- 
ard Oil and Ambrican Tobacco 
cases it was interpreted to forbid 
only unreasonable restraints on 
trade and not all forms of com- 
binations. 

“Rule of Reason” 

That decision became known as 
the ‘“‘rule of reason,’’ and around it 
have centered most of the complaints 
which have led up to the new cru- 
sade against monopolies. 

The “rule of reason’’ 
passage by Congress in 1914 of two 
other laws, the Clayton Act and the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, 
Both major political parties have 
recognized in their platforms the 
weakness of these acts. 

The Clayton Act forbids local price 
discriminations, exclusive dealer ar- 
rangements and similar prejudicial 
contracts by corporations in inter- 
state commerce which tend to lessen 
competition or to create a monop- 
oly, and restricts interlocking direc- 
torates or the holding in certain tn 
| stances of the stock of one company 
| by another, 

The Federal Trade Commission 
Act, 
authorized it to prevent ‘‘unfair 
methods of competition,’’ and to it 
was left discretion to determine 
what constitutes such methods. 
Thus the FTC Act was virtually a 
return to the old English common 
law, except that the commission's 
decisions were made subject to ap-

MAY DAY 

Eighteen years ago Pugene V. 
running for President on the Socialist 
ticket, polled more than 900,000 votes 
If the Socialists and Communists of 
that day could have foreseen the future 
violent ups and downs of our economic 
history—the depression of 1921, the 
Great Depression of 1932 and the new 
depression of today, and especially if 
they could have foreseen that some 
10.000,000 persons would be currently 
estimated to be out of employment, 
they would have taken for granted at 
least an enormous Socialist and Com- 
munist movement, if rot, indeed, actual 
victory at the polls. They would have 
thought it incredible that with economic 
conditions what they were, the Socialist 
candidate in 1936 would poll only 187,- 
000 votes and the Communist 
80,000, even though the total popular 
vote was almost double that of 1920, 
and exceeded 45,000,000. 

This remarkably small progress of 
the Marxist movement must have been 
in the minds of many spectators yester- 
day as they watched the May Day 
parade. The sickle and hammer were 
displayed, clenched fists were raised, 
the “Internationale” was sung; but the 
Socialists and Communists, as parties, 


Debs, 


have not beer growing. Not only, in | 


the last election, did they poll together 
barely one vote in every 200, but more 
than one-fourth of all their votes were 
confined to New York City. 

It is not that there is no radicalism 
in America, but rather that radicalism 
here does not tend to take the Marxist 
form. Ideas like technocracy, $200 a 
month old-age pensions, the sit-down 
strike, may sweep over the country for 
a few months like prairie fires, but 
these are ideas of limited application 
or with concrete goals. The American

reached its height when he came home, 
more than a year later. Only Hobsorl, 
hero of Santiago Harbor, rivaled Dewey 
in that war. Where now are the lovely 
young ladies who welcomed Dewey and 
| kissed Hobson and his men? Alas, for 
vanished innocence! It was forty years

fought, a week later that the news

| of yesteryear? 


A “MORAL RECESSION”? 


The Treasury's analysis of personal 
income taxes for 1936 alarms the Coun- 
cil of Executives of the Committee for 
Religion and Welfare Recovery. Not 
because we are earning less than we 
ever did but that we are apparently 
giving less to good causes. The total 
declared net personal income exclusive 
of deductions was $19,069,137,719 for 
1936, an increase of 30.1 per cent, or 
$4,412,058,298, over 1935. Yet the 
amount contributed to philanthropic 
works in 1936 was only 2.033 per cent 
of the net personal taxable income, a 
matter of $388,142,000. This is the low- 
est percentage reported since 1925, for 
which year it was 2.017. Though the 
law allows exemptions for contribu- 
tions as high as 15 per cent, the ratio 
was only 7.3 per cent even for the 61 
who reported incomes of 
and over for 1936. Never 
have philanthropic donations 
reached 3 per cent. 

Mr. Charlies V. Vickery, president 
of the Golden Rule Foundation and one 
of the active’ spirits in the National 
Committee of Religion and Welfare 
finds here evidence of a 
| “moral recession.” He brushes aside 

the excuse that the “Government is 

taking all our money for taxes” in view 
of the extraordinary rise in income 
shown for 1936 and infers that we are 
spending “untold billions at cocktail 
bars, race tracks, night clubs, and for 
many other luxuries of doubtful cul- 
tural or patriotic value.” We gave 
to churches 33 per cent less in 1936 
than we did in 1925, 35 per cent less 
than in 1926 and 1927 and 40 per 
cent less than in the miraculous year 
of 1928, which preceded the stock mar-

Is the Treasury's table of personal 
income tax returns a true index of 
philanthropic giving? It does not re- 
flect testamentary donations, for ex- 
ample, In 1937 Charles Hayden be- 
queathed $50,000,000 for the education 
of boys and young men; George F., 
Baker $15,000,000 for religious, char- 
itable, educational and other purposes; 
Phelps Smith $7,000,000 for education; 
| Edward A, Filene $2,000,000 for a 
charitable and educational foundation; 
Frank E, Clarke $1,766,671 for reli- 
gious and charitable purposes. Even if 
we regard such legacies as exceptional 
it appears from the annual “index of 
philanthropy” published by the John 
Price Jones Corporation not only that 
our rich men and women have donated 
heavily to science, art and religion, but 
that our community chests show a 
steady increase. In the seven years 
| beginning 1931 the philanthropists of 
| New York, Chicago, Washington, Phil- 
adelphia, Baltimore and Boston gave in 
their lifetime and left in their wills the 
magnificent sum of $1,124,000,000. 
Moreover, the trend of giving and be- 
queathing is upward and not down- 


ward. In addition, we must consider 


the enormous sums spent by States | 


and municipalities on education, public 
health and what may properly be 
called charity. 
Before we can speak of a “moral re- 
cession” we must know how much has 
actually been received from all sources 
by churches, educational institutions, 
hospitals, scientific laboratories, art 
museums and benevolent organizations 
in general. We must also discover what 
our preferences are in, giving and leav- 


ing. Are science, art, education, char- | 
ity, hospitals receiving proportionately 


more than the church? If so, why? 
The question is of grave concern at a 
time when the world was never in more 
dire need cf spiritual elevation.

goes deeper than this. The experience 
of the masses of people in this country 
is such that they cannot take seriously 
the belief that the nation is divided into 
fixed classes, and that economic prog- 


ress is possible only as a “class” and | 


through a “class struggle.” They know 
how great the economic mobility of the 
individual may be. They know how 
amazingly the standard of living of the 
average American worker has risen 
even ‘within the last generation. They 
know how immensely better off the 
American worker is economically than 
the workers of any other country, and 
particularly of other countries ruled by 
authoritarian ideas. Wherever they feel 
their future progress to lie, they know 
it is not in Marxism.

“GHOST-WRITING” 


In a letter to THE TIMES, published 
last week, an excerpt of ghost-writ- 
ing which differed from the familiar 
type was produced. The relations be- 
tween President Roosevelt and business 
were compared by the writer with the 
imagined similar relations of President 
Lincoln (of which there is no other 
evidence) and, for proof of Lincoln’s at- 
titude, a letter was cited which, we are 
informed, “Lincoln wrote to a friend 
back in Illinois.” This letter, which 
pictures Lincoln as seeing “in the near 
future a crisis approaching that un- 
nerves me and causes me to tremble for 
the safety of my country,” has been 
used before. “Corporations have been 
enthroned,” it observes, “with the prob- 
able result that presently all wealth 
| will be aggregated in a few hands and 
| the Republic destroyed.” The letter 
| further remarks: 
I feel at the moment more anxiety 
for the safety of my country than 
ever before, even in the midst of 


war. 
THE Times is asked by its cor- 
| resemblance ?” 

We can discover no close textual re- 
| semblance to any declaration of Mr. 
Roosevelt, and no resemblance at all to 
the ideas and style familiar to readers 
of Mr. Lincoln. If there were no other 
reason for not imputing these remarks 
to Lincoln, the diffuse and hysterical 
wording of the alleged letter would, to 
| any one familiar with Lincoln’s calm 
and compact writing, be convincing evi- 
dence against his authorship. As a 
matter of fact this alleged “Lincoln

THE 


letter,” which has-been produced be- 
fore, was long ago exposed as a clumsy 
forgery. Miss Helen Nicolay, on the 
authority of her father, Lincoin’s pri- 
vate secretary, repudiated its authen- 
ticity in her “Personal Traits of Abra- 
ham Lincoln.” 
was known to Lincoln’s secretaries. It 
does not appear in his collected works; 
no one who quoted it gave the name of 
the individual to whom it was ad- 
dressed. John Hay, who investigated 
its pedigree with skeptical curiosity, 
discovered that “this alleged quotation 
| seems to have made its first appear- 
|) ance in the Presidential campaign of 
1888, and it has returned with planetary 
regularity ever since.” Burton Steven- 
son’s “Home Book of Quotations” 
prints it, but with the footnote, “at- 
tributed to Abraham Lincoln, but prob- 


ably apocryphal.” 


“AMATEUR STRATEGISTS” 


Congressional debate on the Naval 
Expansion Bill and the Army Appropri- 
ation Bill has verified the President's 
assertion that the country is full of 
“amateur strategists.” Lurid pictures 
have been painted of a defenseless 
America, preyed upon by Machiavellian 
spies, while other pictures have given 
us Uncle Sam as an ogre of the Pacific, 
intent on conquest rather than defense. 
The professional strategists, as distin- 

| guished from the amateurs, have been 
partially to blame for the confusion of 
the public mind that must have resulted 
from the reports_of the debates, since 
in their eagerness to support reasona- 
ble bills they have made unreasonable 

| statements, 

In the interest of accuracy Congress 

| should dismiss’ as fantasy the idea so 

| frequently advanced in committee 
rooms and on the floor—-the idea that 
the combined navies of the so-called 
totalitarian States, Germany, Italy and 
Japan, might attack this country, sink 
our fleet, and by blockade or invasion 
defeat the United States. The prospect 
is patently absurd. Even the total 


combined fleets of those nations are | 


probably inferior in fighting power to 
| our own navy; and, moreover, one can- 
| not imagine the circumstances under 
which that combined strength could be 
| applied against the American Navy. 
Even were Japan, Germany and Italy 
able and willing to strip their own 
coasts of all protection, an overseas 
expedition thousands of miles from 
bases would leave the attacking fleets 
of these, or any other Powers, at a 
definite disadvantage—one so great 
that it would insure their almost cer- 
| tain defeat. 
There is another point made by the 


 canaltal strategists” that also needs | 


| to be refuted. There is not and there 

cannot be, from the very nature of | 
naval warfare, any such thing as “‘na- | 
val frontiers,” or “sea defense lines.” 

One cannot dig trenches in the ocean; 

“the distinguishing feature of a naval 

force,” writes Mahan, “is mobility.” 

Fleets can no more reasonably be re- 

stricted to certain areas in peacetime 

than they can be expected to defend 
some imaginary line drawn across the | 
| ocean in wartime. Naval war is not | 
waged that way; fleets are mobile, and 
| their mobility depends, to a great ex- 
| tent, upon bases. The Naval Expansion 
| Bill does not provide for the establish- | 
| ment of new bases in the Western Pa- 
| cific or elsewhere; those who profess to 
see in its terms danger of our reversion 
to the era of “manifest destiny” would 
| do well, therefore, to look elsewhere for 
their ammunition. 

Little reasonable fault can be found 
| with the present legislation intended to 
| improve our army and strengthen our 

navy, but its proponents and opponents 
| harm their own causes and confuse the 

public mind by pointless and unneces- 





sary exaggeration. The only reason for | 


| national defense is national safety; 

| these bills are intended to provide a 
reasonable measure of safety in a world 
arming to the teeth; more would be un- 
reasonable, less unwise. 


SPAIN’S CHILDREN 


No matter how or when the war in 

| Spain ends there will be children on 

both sides of the present fighting line | 

| who will be in need of milk, medicine, | 

hospital care and other essentials to 

| health. They are desperately in need 
of those things now. The Quakers, 
working with equal zeal in both Na- 
tionalist and Loyalist territory, are 
trying to cope with a situation for | 
which they have tragically inadequate 
resources. They have not taken sides. | 
They do not indict either Government. 
They appeal to a humanity which“no | 

Government and no people can disclaim. 

| To aid them in their work the Span- 

| ish Child Welfare of America, of which

Colonel Lindbergh will 
apparently make his per- 
manent home in France. 
It is on a small island off 
the Breton coast, where he 

will be a neighbor of Dr. Carrel, his 
| associate in the “artificial heart” ex- 
periments. The caption in today’s pic- 
| ture section says that the Lindbergh 
| home has been purchased in the name 
| of Mme. Carrel, since foreigners may 
| not own real property in strategic 
| zones. 
| This suggests the faintest shadow 
| of a plot which the adventure novelists 
| might do something with. It also ties 
| up with the news of England and 
| France joining hands for defense 

against a threat from the Continent. 

The general idea would be a Central 

European air fleet heading for Paris 
; and London and the British air com- 
| mander in chief on his way to intercept 

them. He crashes off the French coast, 
| bails out and lands on a rocky islet. 
| There he finds a man to whom he ex- 
| plains in broken French how impera- 
| tive it is that the commander in chief 

reach Paris in a couple of hours. The 

man on the island, speaking with an 
| American accent, tells the air com- 
| mander that he thinks it can be man-

On Oct. 31, 1936, Alfred 

Old E. Smith delivered at Al- 
American bany the closing speech in 

Theory his anti-Roosevelt cam- 

paign. The peroration, in 
part, reads as follows: 

“Let us look at our country. Let us 
look at God’s country, because that is 
what I believe it to be. * * * It had 
His grace and His choicest blessings 
| from the very first day that He per- 
| mitted the prow @ the Santa Maria to 

pierce the veil that opened it up to 
civilization, and from that day made it 


|a haven of repose and a harbor of 


refuge for the downtrodden, the poor 


| and the oppressed of every land. * * * 


“And here in the time of our chil- 
dren He made the United States of 
America the instrumentality of His Di- 
vine Providence for the preservation 
of world civilization.” 


Then last Thursday at

And lastly! We believe that this

NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1938. 


Seeking to Remove Bars to Recovery 


Moratorium on Experimentation and a Fresh Venture in 


National Cooperative 


To THE Eprror or THe New York Tres: 

This is an attempt to appraise the 
current American situation in terms 
not of group or sectional needs but of 
the national interest, It proceeds from 
the premise that beneath the clash of 
conflicting demands and more _ im- 
mediate concerns labor, industry and 
government have fundamental interests 
in common. Each, for example, has 
claims upon the national income, but 
only as the total income is adequate can 
these claims, in the long run, be satis- 
fied. 

Today the total is both inadequate 
and ominously shrinking. With the 
claims of all in jeopardy, there are only 
two ways out. One is for all parties to 
lower standards, abandon hopeful plans 
and reduce their claims. The other is 
for all parties to set aside their differ- 
ences and unite in a common effort to 
raise the nationa] income, until it is 
adequate to their demands. 

The choice would seem to be clear. It 


is safe to say that this nation is not yet | 


ready to give up the struggle for gen- 
eralgemployment, higher living stand- 
ards and better government. This much 
| the President recognized when he pro- 
posed as a target a national income of 
some eighty billion dollars. Nor is the 
| figure extravagant. Indeed, if the na- 
| tions! economy is to absorb the unem- 
| ployed, maintain American living stand- 
| ards and support the governmental es- 
| tablishment in terms of present commit- 
ments, an income of ninety billions 
| would be none too high. The important 
| thing is not the figure, however, but the 
| need for which it stands, and it is only 
too clear that if we are to move for- 
ward instead of being forced backward, 
some such expansion is essential. The 
| question is how to induce it. 


| Coercion Impossible 

| The word induce is used advisedly, for 
experience suggests that genuine recov- 
ery is not to be coerced. Deliberate in- 
flation, for example, might readily pro- 
duce a hectic round of activity and swell 
the paper profits of the nation, but only 
‘at the cost of sacrificing the producer 
to the speculator, the consumer to the 
profiteer, the plain citizen to the ad- 
| venturer. a 
Nor is this the only danger. To em- 
| bark now upon a vast ney program of 
government spending is to adopt the 
gambler’s expedient; it is to double the

| and imperative step. Indeed, a mora- 
torium on further experimentation— 
whether monetary or social—is now 
| clearly indicated; nor is this to be con- 
| fused with blind hostility to reform. As | 
| undigested securities have provoked 
| crises in the past, so undigested inno; 
| vations have provoked one now. The 
| time has come when the simplification 
| and stabilization of the rules are essen- 

tial to recovery. The time has also come 

when recovery alone can underwrite the 
| gains which reform has already made. 





| plank in the new La Foilette Progres- | Mutual Concessions 
But the requirements are more than | 


Only through concessions by | 
all parties, for example, could a two- 
year cooperative program be fairly 
launched. It would mean relief from 
some of the least digestible of govern- 
ment’s innovations. It would mean re- 
lief from strikes and lock-outs, a period 
in which industry and labor agree to ne- 
gotiate and arbitrate rather than fight. 
It would mean a general recognition of 
the fact that industry’s contribution to 
workers, investors and general public 

depends primarily upon profits. 

| On such a foundation it should be pos- | 
| sible to build with. confidence. The | 


negative. 





| plans, of course, would have to be care- 
| full articulated, but in order to sug- 
gest their shape and outline, the fol- 
lowing specifications are set forth: | 
1. Taxation—Conceding the necessity | 
for large government revenues, it is | 
submitted that tax rates as well as | 
other rates are subject to the law of 
diminishing returns. Lower rates today 
might well encourage such an increase 
in profits as to swell total revenues; 
| certainly they are essential to any genu- 


ine business expansion, Pending, there- 
| 





fore, & comprehensive study of the en- 
| tire tax structure, Congress might well 

adopt the principle that taxes upon busi- 
ness and incomes be promotional rather 
than punitive. Specifically it is proposed 
that the undistributed, profits tax be 





| 
| 


set aside in favor of a flat corporation | 


tax, with substantial rebates provided 
for (a) expenditures for replacement of 
obsolete equipment and (b) increases 
in employment and wages. 

These rebates would more than pay 
for themselves. They would serve at 


Effort Are Suggested 


once to ease the unemployment and 
the budgetary problems. They would 
strengthen the whole social-economic 


structure. They would reduce the need | 
for government subsidies and aid the Country, which &® @ow prosperous 


collection of necessary revenues. 

2. Government Competition—Deriving 
from no clear popular mandate, but 
rather from emergency activities on the 
one hand and certain conservation poli- 
cies on the other, the depressing effects 
of government competition upon certain 


key industries, and hence upon enter- | 


prise as a whole, have recently become 
all too apparent. Its prompt curtail- 
ment and progressive reduction are un- 
doubtedly essential to the expansion if 
not indeed to the maintenance of free 
enterprise, For the basic fact about gov- 
ernment competition is that it is not 


out showing a profit, government agen- 


cies can undersell and hence crush any | 


private competition at will. Faced with 
such masterful competitors, of whose 
ultimate intentions they are left in the 


to make commitments? 
So_far as the light and power indus- 


try is concerned, one must recognize, | 
to be sure, the existence of a compli- | 


cated problem, a dispassionate solution 
| that prosperity could be got out of our 


of which is not to be reached out of 
hand. Pending such a definitive solution, 
however, it seems no more than reason- 
able that the public should not be sad- 
dled with the further duplication of ex- 
isting facilities, and that the utilities be 
advised of definite and reasonable limits 
beyond which, for the specified period, 
government agrees not to extend its 
operations, 


Widespread Threat 


In the field of credit it is possible to 
be more specific. Unless the right to 
credit is to be determined by political 


| rather than economic tests, the lending | 
activities of the government should nor- | 
mally be no more than regulatory, pro- | 


motional or, in exceptional cases, supple- 
mentary, The scope of its present activi- 
ties threatens not only the banks and 
the Treasury but the people as a whole. 
Aside from offering assurances that the 
scope will not be extended, the govern- 
ment might well consider such definite 
steps as the sale to the banks, in large 
blocks, of the RFC’s current assets. 
This would at once reduce the contin- 
gent liability of the taxpayer, enable 
the government to retire some part of 
its debt and help to diversify banking 
assets. It would also dramatize, as few 
moves could, the government’s intention 


to withdraw from destructive competi- | 
| how 


tion with private enterprise. 

3. The Dollar and the Budget—To elim- 
inate uncertainty and thus facilitate 
commitments, assurance should be given 
that for the period in question no in- 


| crease in the price of gold or silver is 


ject always to the requirements of ex- 
isting law, credit operations and interest 
rates will be subjected to a minimum of 
political or bureaucraticcontrol, Astothe 
budget, it should be agreed that during 
this period subsidies to agriculture and 
other special groups should at least not 
be increased, and that every effort will 
be made to work out a relief formula 
which will correlate Federal and local 
contributions while offering its re- 
cipients genuine inducement to seek 
private and permanent employment. 
We cannot live indefinitely on the in- 
terest of what we owe. 


| Arbitration Policy 


4. Industrial Peace—A two-year truce— 


based generally upon the maintenance | 


| Plenty of Symbols 


of present agreements—is imperative if 
maximum productivity is 
proached. During this period, therefore, 
the neutral arbitration of disputes 
should be the accepted and declared 


whenever government is a party, of 
government as well. All parties would 


likewise have to pledge their best ef- | 


forts to see that their own houses are 


set in order, and their policies coordi- | 


nated to the spirit and letter of this 


program, 
5. Low-Cost Housing—Here is a field 


in which government, finance, industry | 
and labor might well make an affirma- | 
tive demonstration of what can be done 

by cooperation in accordance with exist- | 
ing laws. In return for Federal mort- | 


gage insurance the other parties might 
well agree: the banks to make gen- 


erous loans at relatively low rates, in- | 


dustry to furnish materials in volume 
at relatively low vrices, labor to accept 
some small reduction in the wage rate 
in return for steady employment. Pro- 
vision should also be made for the arbi- 
tration of all disputes. 

It may well be said that such a pro- 
gram is all well enough, but there is 
little chance of securing the coopera- 
tion it requires. It is a fact, however, 
that this program has already been dis- 
cussed and approved 
responsible representatives of industry 
and labor; hence a government which 
undertook to promote it would not have 
to start from scratch. With the Presi- 
dent recognizing the need for a higher 
national income and Congress seeking 
to clear the road for enterprise, there 
is* always a chance that a program 
which propeses to combine and imple- 
ment these objectives may carry more 
than an academic appeal.

Changing Definitions 
To THE Epiror or THe New York Times: 
The proposal of the government to 
substitute for its present accounting 
methods a new form of bockkeeping 
whereby it will have neither a debt nor 


a deficit is an example of how to make 
a simple task more difficult. What this 


free from foreign influence. 

Why is the government in financial 
troubles? Because in trying to balance 
the budget it is using a definition bor- 
rowed from an old English dictionary, 
in which it states that to balance means 
to equalize the force of two opposites 
such as credit and debit. What out- 
tmoded terminology! By simply inserting 


country needs is not a new bookkeeping | 
system but a new American dictionary, | 


after the word balance in the diction- 
ary the definition that balance means 
any situation whereby two opposites 
strike a seventy-thirty ratio, we can 
immediately apply this definition to the 
budget and balance it. 

There are also other definitions 
which could be revised. For instance, 
since we have tried all sorts of experi- 
ments and have not brought back pros- 
perity, why not change the definition 
of the word so that prosperity will 
mean any state of the nation when not 
more than 
ployed? By this simple change in the 


dictionary we could have prosperity | 
immediately. Many of our gravest prob- 


lems could be solved by changing defi- 
nitions. Mark Taser.

one of the recondite treatises in which 
it is recorded. Here it is, as propounded

Latin and Greek Required

To THE Epitor or Tue New York Trues: 

Katherine Roof’s letter on stand- 
ards of speech, with her , Reino’ 
that ‘requirements of our university 
and colleges were formerly much 
higher than they are now,” recalls 
an early entrance examination in a 
New England institution of learning: 

“‘When any scholar is able to un- 
derstand Tulley, or such like Latine 
author extempore, and make and 
speake true Latine in verse and 
prose * * * and decline * * * the 
paradigms of nounes and verbes in 
the Greek tongue: Let him then be 
capable of admission.” 

The mental training such study 
stimulated and developed was ably 
reflected not only in their language 
but also in the institutions those 
early Americans established.

| Edueation’s Ailments 


They Are Due Largely to Ignoring 
Practical Things 


To THE Epitor or THe New York Times: 

It is perhaps naive to place one’s 
finger on a particular disorder of the 
many which haunt an organism or in- 
stitution and say this is it. For, after 


all, the nature of the diagnosis depends | 


upon the kind of diagnostician. It is, 
therefore, with reservations that I sug- 
gest that the chief ailment of education 
traces to the divorce 
and practice, knowledge and action. 
Knowledge, so it is claimed by the 
nabobs of the educational realm, is the 
distinct province of a select few high 
priests whose chief virtue it is to main- 
tain an even keel away from the reefs 


of practical achievement into the calm | 


waters of golden contemplation. Action 
is reserved for a multitude of 
petents who take the field of achieve- 
ment as a defense reaction to a complex 
of inferiority. 
the other a necessary nuisance. 


Lack of Unity 

One net result is that educators them- 
selves tend to bifurcate into conflict- 
ing camps instead of uniting in common 


cause against vicissitudes which humans | 


and institutions which are their children 
carry in their trains. It breaks the edu- 
cational program up into contending 
fields of ‘‘vocational’? and ‘‘cultural,”’ 
each sticking its tongue out at the other. 
It renders the college man 
any form of accomplishment other than 
that which is possible in a white collar. 
He thinks 
plow as a “‘clodhopper’”’ and of him who 
has tangential relation with a cow as a 
“hick.”’ 


You hear people saying, ‘‘Make edu- | 


cation practical.’’ You don’t hear them 

‘‘Make practical things educa- 
Many of the nabobs will tolerate

a little speculation 
thinking within that 
only in some form of mental abortion. 
But to invest the things of home and 
shop and farm factory and mine 
with educational regalia is to commit an

original sin against Greek and medieval

posits of value to civilization. It is but 
little wonder that some modern intel-

nostalgia for the artistry of the one and 
the rigor and finality of the other.

_THE NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, MAY 1, 1938, 





Ejire’s President 


The Irish-Irish 


To THE Epiror oF THE New York Times: 

Mrs. Anne O’Hare McCormick's re- 
cent column in THe Times on Dr. Doug- 
las Hyde, the new President of Eire, was 
a good piece of reporting, and she in- 
timated the racial ideology behind his 
appointment. 

Dr. Hyde is not so well known here 
as he is in Ireland and the isles and on 
the Continent. Somehow, one likens him 
to that other uniquely gifted Irishman, 
the late AE. More than AE, Dr. Hyde 
came from the Irish tradition or, as we 

| say in Ireland, the ‘‘Irish-Irish tradi- 

tion,’’ by way of contradistinction to the 

“Anglo-Irish tradition,’’ which for so 

many years held a usurped ascendancy 

| there and which to the Irish was 

| spurious—-neither fish nor fowl nor good 
| red herring. ° 


That tradition, of course, had none of | 


the native values, and its very litera- 
ture was for the Irish a fake. Even with 
hearts bowed down, the native Irish 
never revealed themselves with ‘‘a 
| stranger in the house’’—symbolic Celtic 
| idiom for the invader—and under their 
broken rooftrees they furtively brewed 
in secret the precious distillate of their 
nationhood. 


| A Gaelic Scholar 


It is significant that he is ranked among 
the greatest living Gaelic scholars, and 
he has done work of inestimable value 
in reviving the native language, which 
| went into eclipse and almost died out 
under brunt of long-continued assault. 
Indeed, the phenomenon of its revival 
is a sign of the inexhaustible cultural 
energy inherent in the race. Criticisms 
from scorners and skeptics have been 
made against its revival, but the Irish, 
who form an old race that has been 
scorned by experts, are but amused, not 
| seduced, ‘by false foreign accents. The 
native tongue will again posit their way 
of life and enable them to render worthy 
statements of the race in ways nearest 
and dearest to their own hearts. The de- 
sire will not be fulfilled overnight, but 
it will come. It is a Shannon scheme 
of the Irish*mind. The Irish tongue is 
the hallmark of Irish nationality; it is 
the seal of Irish heritage. 


Ti: a deeper and a larger sense, the 
appointment of Dr. Hydé shows Ireland 
| to be ahead of other nations, in that his 
incumbency is in a way an adaptation 
of the old classical ideal of ‘‘philosopher 
kings” as heads of States. He is not a 
| politician, and the man and the office 
as he fills it tend to lift the realm of 
government above 
politics, which Plato defined as 
folly of fools.” 





‘the 


does not depend on such a wretched 
technical detail as more popular democ- 
racies are based on—a plebiscite. 
appointment reveals that the Irish have 


advanced well along the paths of politi-, 


cal ideation in the past few years under 
self-government; 
race that spoke through Mr. de Valera 
and Mr. Cosgrave when they 
on their foremost Protestant citizen. It 
is the same race that has given the 
world a Diuchuil, Sedulius, Duns Scotus, 
Scotus Eriugena, Columbanus, Columb- 
cille, a Burke and a Berkeley. 


Viewed as Symbol 


Dr. Hyde is himself a most admirable 
man, and he has magnificence of char- 
acter in the old classical sense of the 
term. He is a symbol. The Irish, being 
an aristocratic, aloof and a lonely peo- 
ple, are monarchical-minded. Their 
President will be for them what the 
King is for the English people—in a 
sense a higher symbol, since he em- 
bodies also intellectual and cultural 
nobility, a quality the Irish always ad- 
mired. 

And the country people, in their court- 
ly, charming way, as your correspond- 
ent Hugh Smith aptly pointed out, call 
him “the delightful little branch’’— 
i. e., of the living tree that is Eire. 


We may look now for a real Irish 
renaissance, of which V/illiam B. Yeats’s 
Celtic renascence was the prelude; and 
the Old Land may relive her golden age 
in terms of today. 

The Irish are looking up again, and 
their brows are bound with the light of 
peace. T. F. Heaty.

‘Personal Touch Needed | 


Modern ‘Town Meeting’ Found | 
Lacking Important Element | 


To THE Eprror oF THE NEw YORK TIMES: 

George Gallup’s ‘‘The American Mind,” 
or rather Cesare’s cartoon, in THe New 
York Times Magazine prompted the fol- 
lowing reaction: 

The New England town meeting, in 
spite of its many shortcomings, still re- | 
mains as an ideal in the minds of all 
true believers in democracy. Various 
attempts are being made to reproduce | 
the conditions of the ‘‘town meeting’’— | 
over the radio, and through various lo- 
cal activities. 

It seems to me that all these modern 


aan aaiiies Zit | attempts to duplicate the conditions of | 
One &. Was Seen a | the original town meeting are lacking | 
| in several essential characteristics. And 


agreed | it is just this lack that is leading us into 


fooling ourselves. I woke up to this 
fact at a dinner meeting of one of our 
associations especially interested in pub- 
lic education. 

After a withering attack on the cost 
oi the public schools by one speaker, @ 
school official rose and said, ‘‘Mr. B., 


will you please lay your cards on the 
| table, and tell this audience just 'whom 


do you represent at this meeting?” ' 
You see, right there is the essential 
weakness of the attempt to’ duplicate | 
the town meeting in our complex con- 
Those who attended the 


much credit to give to their arguments, 
because they knew each one personally, 
and whether the speaker had a keen 
mind, ordinary common sense, or was 
just a loud-mouthed boob. 

I submit that we who listen so trust- 
ingly to various forms of ‘‘town meet- 
ing’ discussions are woefully lacking in 
just this essential knowledge. 

Therefore I suggest that each speaker 
at each of these meetings be required to 
submit beforehand a brief description 
of himsel*, such as might appear in his 
obituary when he passes on: his origin, 
education, honors, business connections, 
clubs and other associations. From such

Pay in Civil Service 


Equa] Compensation Is Urged for 
Comparable Work 


To THE Epitor or THe New York Trves: 
With the Constitutional Convention in 
session this is an opportune time to sug- 
article re- 
lating to civil service to read as fol- 
‘“‘Equal compensation shall be 


similar duties and have similar respon- 
sibilities.’’ 

H. Eliot Kaplan has offered cogent 
reasons for leaving the provision for 
civil service in the Constitution alone. 
He has said: ‘‘What may be deemed to 
and workable today may 
prove to be onerous and impractical at 
a later date.””’ The burden of proof 
does rest upon any one who suggests 
service provisions. I submit, however, 
that equal 
work is so important in public manage- 
ment that a constitutional provision is 
essential to accomplish all the positive 
results of a merit system. 

There is no scientific method in the 
municipal or State service for establish- 
ing position classification at the present 
Compensation is paid according 
to the title of the position, but there is 
no administrative mechanism available 
for insuring that the duties actually per- 
formed and the _ responsibilities as- 
sumed are in accordance with the title 


| and the attendant compensation. 


Out-of-Title Work 


The studies leading up to the estab- | 


lishment by Congress of a classification 


| system for the Federal civil service in 

1923 indicated an enormous amount of | 
reason to believe that a similar con- | LESS: Mud-Slinging

only method for the prevention of this 


unfortunate condition, continuous clas- | 


sification by a technically trained staff 


attached to the personnel agency, is not | 


in use in New York. 


There are a number of significant rea- | 
| sons for the application of this principle | 
to public employment. 


sation for equal work increases morale 


| because it insures equality of treatment 


It makes possible the creation of a ca- 


| reer service by defining levels of re- 


sponsibility and by indicating lines of 
promotion. It puts recruitment require- 
ments on the only sound and objective 
basis possible; namely, analysis of the 
positions for which recruits are sought. 


| It conserves the efficiency of the serv- 


ice by requiring performance according 
to compensation. 


Provision Desirable

tion as the selection of employes by 
means of the merit system. As such it 
in the Constitution. 
Once included there, the Legislatures of 
the State and cities can provide ade- 
quate machinery for its application. 
Fifteen years of experience with clas- 
sification in Washington, which, inci- 
dentally, was urged on Congress by the 
civil service employes, indicate that 


equal compensation for equal work can | 


be attained and is desirable. It is in-

Today there are literally millions 
of refugees. Estimates have ranged 
from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000. Among 
the migrants are representatives of 
almost every race and creed, and 
every social class. Priests as well as 
radicals have been proscribed, mon- 
archists as well as republicans, cap- 
italists as well as Communists. 

Anti-Semitism has singled 
out as the chief factor, but in Ger- 
and Austria together there 
are said to be only about 75),000 
Jews. This figure, of course, does 
not tell the whole story, for under 
the Nuremberg law, broadly speak- 
ing, any one is classed as non 
Aryan who has among his grand- 
, even one of Jewish an- 
cestry. But in the total number of 
refugees needing help the Jews, 
even by that definition, are not nec- 
essarily a majority. In Austria the 
refugees include supporters of the 
Dollfuss and Schuschnigg regimes, 
of whatever race From Spain 
there are thousands of refugees of 
all political faiths. 

Complications Found 

The problem of helping these peo- 
ple is complex. In many instances 
they have been deprived not only 
of citizenship but of all resources 
First there is the problem of re- 
movai from the countries which no 
longer want them. Then comes the 
problem of finding new homes for 
them in other lands, establishing 
them there, helping them to become 
self-supporting. 

Fortunately for them, the experi- 
ence of the League in the work 
done by the Nansen and McDon- 
ald Committees is available to any 
new organization which may be es- 
tablished. The Nansen Committee 
had a major part in re-establishing 
about 1,500,000 Russian refugees 
and easing the lot of perhaps as 
many proscribed persons in the 
Near East, as well as untangling 
the affairs of thousands of prison- 
ers of war on both sides.

it is well known that these people, 
so slight a scattering in our 130,- 
000,000, have already enriched this 
country in scholarship, science, 
music and other intellectual fields. 
Refugees as Assets 

Looking backward, one sees that 
it was the Flemings driven to Eng- 
land by’ Spain and the refugee 
French Huguenots whe established 
Britain’s silk industry. Greeks ex- 
pelled from Turkey established the 
rug and carpet industry in Greece. 
In Thrace, Greece, Bulgaria and 
Palestine experience has shown that 
even in lands already settled it is 
possible for large numbers of refu- 
gees to establish themselves, be- 
come self-supporting and even add 
to the national wealth as farmers. 

Also looking backward, one learns 
that no country that has welcomed 
refugees has failed to prosper. 


By F. LAURISTON BULLARD 


BOSTON, April 29.—The question 
of the married woman worker is a 
live issue in Massachusetts. Stormy 
legislative hearings have been held 
both last year and this on Beacon 
Hill on a bill, promoted by the Wo- 
men’s Political Club, providing for 
a survey of the extent of such em- 
ployment of married women and 
its effect on the public relief rolls. 
The club economic grounds, 
opposes the employment in the pub- 
lic women whose hus- 
bands are able to support them. The 
“the right to 


on 
of 


service 


opposition stands for 


+ work.” 


Whatever may be the fate of the 
bill this session, the exclusion move- 
ment is gaining. The Boston Edi- 
son Company, which employs about 
800 women, while not disturbing 
any married women now on the 
payrolls, will employ no more such 
women, and any girl who marries 
after Saturday, April 30, must re- 
sign within thirty days after the 
wedding. 

The immediate result of the an- 
nouncement has been a rush for 
marriage licenses. The company 
holds that “‘a girl who can get 
ready to marry ought to be able to 
quit work.”” Economic considera-

the aid of Edward VIII and later 
of Pope Pius to obtain control of 
the five sisters whom at the age of 
one week he had contracted to ex- 
hibit at the Chicago World’s Fair, 
took the field this time with the 
support of French Canadian na- 
tionalism. Since French national- 
ism is now very much to the fore 
in Canada Mr. Dionne may_ have | 
reckoned that its backing would be | 
decisive. The particular organiza- 
tion on which he relied was l’Asso- 
ciation Canadienne Francaise d’Ed- 
ucation d’Ontario, whose object is 
to protect French Canadian educa- 
tional rights in the premier prov- 
ince of Canada, 


But perhaps Mr. Dionne had for- 
gotten what good friends Premier 
Hepburn of Ontario and Premier 
Maurice Duplessis of Quebec had 
become. At any rate the latest af- 
faire Dionne failed to become a 
sensation in Quebec. 


The time seemed propitious for 





tions alone determine the adoption 
of this policy. 

The New England Power Associ- 
ation, with offices and plants wide- 
ly scattered over this section and 
employing about 2,000 women, 
adopted this plan four years ago. 
As a result, single girls no longer 
resent the ‘‘advantages’” of their 
married comrades in the same of- 
fice. Various smaller concerns in 
Massachusetts and adjacent States 
have followed this precedent. 


Ban Among Teachers 

Among the seventy-two Massachu- 
setts municipalities which employ 
no married teachers permanently 
are such cities as Boston, Worces- 
ter, Quincy, New Bedford, Brock- 
ton and Fitchburg. The rules how- 
ever, is not always well enforced. 

In Somerville, a suburban city of 
100,000, right now a lively clash is 
on over the intention of the Mayor 
to eliminate from the employ of 
the city all working wives whose 
husbands are physically and men- 
tally able to support them. 

The Supreme Court has held that 
a town or city may dismiss married 
teachers provided there is no dis- 
crimination. In general over the 
State the economic argument seems 
to be winning its way.

Oliva Dionne, The quintuplets speak 
French reasonably well but know 
no English. Dr. Blatz, a Toronto 
psychologist who until recently su- 
pervised their education, had in- 
structed Claire Tremblay, their 
teacher, and Jacqueline Noel, nurse, 
to begin English instruction. When 
they failed to do this they were dis- 
missed. Mr. Dionne championed 


their cause and demanded that they | 


be reinstated. 

The father’s lawyer, Henri 
Jacques, asserted in a request to 
the Ontario Government for a judi- 
cial investigation that attempts had 
been made to estrange the quin- 
tuplets from their parents and that 
Dr. Dafoe had been “placing the 
public ahead of the girls them- 
selves.’’ It was asserted that their 
administration expenses could be 
cut at least $10,000 a year. Mr. 
Dionne demanded custody of his 
daughters and control of their edu- 
cation, leaving their finances to a 
new board of guardians. 

To all these statements Dr. Dafoe 
replied: 

“‘We wish to make it clear that 
all we are concerned with is the 
welfare of the children. Now that 
they are worth $600,000 strong in-

trying to influence their father. I 
don’t think he (Oliva Dionne) is be- 
ing well advised. 

Doctors’ Verdict Cited 


“It is said that the children have 
not been allowed to lead a normal 
life. Would they ever have an op- 
portunity to do anything of the 
sort? Do the royal princesses of 
England lead a normal life? 


“‘They say the children should not 
be shown to the public. If they 
were locked behind high fences 
with guards all about to keep the 
public from seeing them, would that 
be a normal life? Leading doctors 
and psychologists from al over 
America have pronounced them un- 
spoiled, lacking in self-conscious- 
ness, normal, natural children.”’ 

What the Ontario Government did 

as tc refuse Mr. Dionne’s requests 
instead endorse recom- 
mendations made by Percy Wilson, 
Ontario's official guardian of minor 
children and one of the quintuplets’ 
guardians, who had conducted a 
preliminary inquiry into his com- 
plaints. "Mr. Wilson had proposed 
that the bilingual section of the 


and to 


Ontario Educational Department be 
put 


in charge of the quintuplets’ 
education, that the rest of the 
Dionne children be educaté@ at the 


expense of their famous sisters and 
that their father receive $300 in- 
stead of $100 per month from them, 
These recommendations had already 
been carried out. 


Mr. Wilson had reported against 
reinstatement of the dismissed 
teachers, declaring that Dr. Dafoe’s 
position as supreme in all matters 
affecting the health of the quin- 
tuplets should be maintained. But 
he suggested that the guardians 
consider ‘‘growing administrative 
costs.”’ 


Larger Home Planned 


S now, with their sky again 
clear of trouble, the quintuplets will 
be able to continue with their job 
of growing up and, in the process, 
augmenting their fortune. That 
amounts to $610,000 at the moment, 

|}and should total $1,000,000 before 
they are 8. Three hundred thou- 
sand dollars of it derives from a 
film contract whose execution will 


probably find them making a fea- | 


ture-length movie on their fourth 
birthday on May 28. They will 
make another before the end of 
1939, and then may quit movie 
making for some years. 


They are now spending their in- 
come, but should soon be able to 
put some of it apart as an addition 
to capital. 


Plans are under consideration to 
give the little sisters a larger home, 
in a wooded park, with a separate 
(school house. In this home an ef- 
fort will be rnade to bring the whole 
; Dionne family more and more to- 

gether and ultimately permanently 

together. But before this is pos- 
}siblx Mr. Dionne probably will 
have to change his present attitude. 

Dr. Dafoe has been a father to 
the quintuplets, and in the four 
years he has cared for them they 
must have filled a place in his large 
and lonely heart. Born peasants, 
they have become princesses with 
natural but gentle manners. They 
are famous and rich in their own 
right.

Enmity Between Martin and ‘Vic’ Meyers 
Of Washington Keeps Executive at Home | 


St. | 





OR PRISONER’ IN STATE 








By RICHARD L. NEUBERGER 


VANCOUVER, Wash., April 29.— 
When Governor Clarence D. Martin 
crossed the Columbia River and 
went into Oregon for half an heur 
several days ago, people here on 
the border wanted him to Hurry 
back before 
Victor Aloysius (just call 
““Vie"") Meyers called the Legisla- 
/ture into special session. 

The warning was not in jest. It 
was part of one of the most garish 
and bizarre political situations in 
the history of the Northwest. If 
the dignified, urbane Governor 
leaves the State for any period of 
time it is believed likely the ebul- 
lient, jazz-minded Mr. Meyers will 
rush to the Capitol, call the Legis- 
lature into action and present a 
program of old-age pensions, addi- 
tional relief benefits, low-cost hous- 
ing and similar advocacies. 

Both the Governor and the Lieu- 
tenant Governor are Democrats. 
The former is classified as a con- 
servative, the latter, who once led 
an orchestra in a Seattle night 
|elub, is regarded as a left-winger. 


| Calls Martin “Prisoner” 

For-a number of years Howard 
| Costigan, secretary of the Wash- 
ington Commonwealth Federation, 
|has boasted that Governor Martin 
lis a “virtual political prisoner.’’ He 
has contended that the Governor 
does not dare go out of the State

|for fear of the liberal and radical 
policies Mr. Meyers might put into 
effect while he was away. 

A few weeks ago, however, Gov- 
ernor Martin decided it was safe 
to go to Washington, D. C., 
urgent State business. His decision 
may have been impelled by the fact 
that the Lieutenant Governor was 
‘away in California. Then Mr. Mey- 
ers’s left-wing allies began to del- 
uge him with pleas to come back 
and call a special session. 


A Race Starts 

Up the Pacific seaboard the Lieu- 
tenant Governor, began a pell-mell 
dash. In Washington the Governor 
learned that once a special session 
was formally called it would prob- 
ably be irrevocable. The Legisla- 
ture would have to convene. At a 
personal cost to himself of $1,380, 
he chartered a special airplane and 
startei westward at 250 miles an 
hour. 

Governor Martin’s plane flew 
across the boundary between Idaho 
and Washington only thirteen min- 
utes before the Lieutenant Gover- 
nor submitted his proclamation for 
a special session. The State Su- 
preme Court ruled that by that 
slender margin the Legislature was 
not required to assemble. 

Now, Governor Martin insists it 
is essential that the next regular 
session of the Legislature enact a 
law which will make it possible

Times Wide Worid 
Governor Martin has to remain in

special legislative session. 














for him to leave the State “‘without | 


| danger of the National Guard being 
called out, a special session of the 
Legislature called, or the peniten- 
tiary gates allegedly opened.” 

Both Mr. Martin and Mr. Meyers 
were elected to their respective 
posts in 1932 and re-elected over- 
whelmingly in 1936. Ever since the 
| Lieutenant Governor made an al- 
lianée with the Commonwealth 
Federation and other left-wing fac- 
tions they have been bitter politi- 
cal adversaries.

Severn—Nine Overcomes Penn, 9-5 


By ROBERT F. KELLEY 


Special to Toe New YorK Times 


ANNAPOLIS, Md., April 30.—\ 
Navy had an excellent day in its 
major sports today, with the base-| 
ball team rallying strongly to de- 
feat Pennsylvania, 9 to 5, and then 
the crews adding one more clean 
sweep in a brilliant regatta as they 
turned back the eights of Cornell 
and Syracuse in the freshman, jun- 
ior varsity and varsity events on 
the rain-swept Severn River after 
the sternest sort of fighting. 

The rowing left Navy still with- 
out defeat this year, but with Cor-| 
nell and Syracuse both going so 
well that there was the strongest | 
confirmation of real power in these | 
three crews. The Middies remain | 
at the top, but both the others are 
right at their shoulders. 


The crowning touch to the Navy 
day was the victory of the varsity 
eight, and it came in the last few 
strokes of a great race which was 
the climax of one of the best regat- 


| tas the Severn has seen in a good 


many years. In ail three contests 
the Ithacans fought all the way to 
the wire with their favored Navy 
rivals and right on their rudder 
posts in the junior and varsity 
races were the Syracuse crews for 
most of the distance. 

When Navy won the varsity 
event, it marked the second time 
during the rainy afternoon of rac- 
ing that Annapolis crews had come 
from behind to win, both times

Hank Borowy, 
more pitching 
credit for a two-hit victory over 
N. Y. U. yesterday at Fordham 
Field when the umpires stopped the 
ball game after a shower fell and 
the Violets had been retired in the 
first half of the seventh inning. 
That some 4,000 spectators were in 
accord with the move was clearly 
evident The score was 4—2 

The weather spoiled what figured 
to be one of the best games of the 
college campaign. With the teams 
starting in semi-darkness and play- 
ing the first three innings in the 
face of severe cross-winds and rain, 
in the contest waned as

unbearable. 

Borowy’s blinding spead, to which 
he added a sharp-breaking curve, 


kept N. Y. U. at bay until the fifth, 
when the Violets scored both their 
runs without hitting the ball out of 
the infield. By that time, however, 
Fordham already had its four runs, 
so there was little cause to worry. 
On the other hand, Sophomore Ed 
Boell, on the mound for N. Y. U., 
also moved along nicely, as the 
Rams reached him for only four 


safeties But his teammates were 
jittery in the field. In all, six mis- 


plays were officially charged against 
the losers. 

Fordham scored its first run in 
the second on a “freak” home run 
by Johnny Metoskie. It was a loop-

ITHACA, N. Y., April 30.—Cornell

home runs by Mike Stehnach and 
Jack Lozier, to defeat Columbia, 
12—7, today and continue unde- 
feated with three victories in 
as many Eastern Intercoliegiate

Cornell spotted Columbia a run in 
the first on Bob Stoltz’s triple and 
Bill Stickel’s single but scored four 


| in the same frame on four hits, two 
| walks and Jack Moller’s three-base | 


error. Moller, who started on the 
mound for the Lions, went out in 
the third after he issued another 


| walk and gave hits to Al Gally and 


Lozier for two more Cornell runs. 

Columbia scored twice in the 
fourth on two hits and an error 
and sent Worth Dodd to the show- 
ers in the third by counting again 
on a single and two walks. Bill 
Bensley checked Columbia from 
there until the ninth, when singles

Nedayr Finishes Fifth 
At the finish, Myron Selznick’s 
Can’t Wait was running past tired 
horses to take the place and re-| 


?/deem himself for his dull race of | 


a week ago. It is probable that 


lhe, too, will be shipped West, but | 


the same cannot be said of Nedayr, 
who finished fifth, back of Bourbon 
King. A non-Derby eligible, Opera 
Hat, held on to be third after he 
had set all the early pace, 

Fighting Fox ran coupled in the| 
betting with the Wheatley Stable’s 
Quick Devil, who had little chance, 
as he went into the air when the 
Galloping along back 
of the field, Quick Devil passed | 
only one horse, the outsider, Wood | 
Song, who was pulled up. 

All the starters carried level 
weight of 120 pounds, and it is in- 
teresting to note that while Fight- 
ing Fox’s time was a full second 
slower than the stake record, and 
almost two seconds behind Sting’s 
track record, it was three-fifths of 
a second faster than thatgmade by | 
Gallant Fox in 1930. The entry of | 
Fighting Fox and Quick Devil 
closed a hot choice at 9 to 10 from 
a high of even money or 11 to 10 
at the most. 

Bourbon King 4-1 Shot 

King went to the post 
under late play, while 
Nedayr was the third choice at 
6 to 1. There was only desultory 
backing for the others, which was) 
not surprising, since few horses 
have been as widely discussed this | 
Spring as Fighting Fox, who made 
so successful a cebut last week. 

Fighting Fox’s share of the purse, 
$17,450, made him the largest’!

walked and Lozier connected for 
the circuit. Both four-base blows 
were made off John Cerny’s deliv-

For Giants’ 9th Victory in Row 


But Coffman Is Called to Rescue in 9th— 
Mungo Removed After Rain in 7th Causes 
a 30-Minute Delay—31,723 Attend 


By JOHN DREBINGER 


Surmounting no end of difficulties 
which included a downpour of rain 
that forced a thirty-minute inter- 
ruption at the close of the seventh, 
Carl Hubbell, with the help of a 
ninth-inning lift from Dick Coff- 
man, silenced a hostile section of 
31,723 fans who openly avowed al- 
legiance to Flatbush, and thrilled 


the remainder of the spectators by | 


turning back the Dodgers, 3 to 1, 
in the opening clash of a three- 
game series at the Polo Grounds 
yesterday 

This major achievement enabled 


the Giants to extend their astound- | 


ing early season winning streak to 
nine straight in addition to main- 


| taining their blistering pace at the 
van of the National League race} 


with ten victories against one de- 
feat. 


j 
For a man just recovering from | 


an attack of influenza it seemed, 
indeed, a trying afternoon, but Old 
Hub sort of thrives on such things. 
The going proved even too tough 
for the more robust Van Lingle 
Mungo, who faded from the struggle 
during the délay after the seventh. 
Manush Draws Pass 

But King Carl hung on until the 
ninth when, after he had held the 
straining Dodgers to five blows and 
their lone tally, he passed Heinie 
Manush and Dolph Camilli. Then 
he pitched two more balls to Kiki 
Cuyler, who had nudged him for 
three blows. Colonel Bill Terry pon- 


dered a moment, called on Coffman 
in the next and presently all the 
Dodgers were called out. 

For though Burleigh Grimes in 
vain tossed two pinch-hitters into 
the ninth, nothing at all resulted 
from the two passes and Hub’s sec- 
| ond victory of the year remained in- 
tact. 

Hubbell and Mungo maintained a 
scoreless deadlock until the fourth 
when a misplay by the veteran 
Woody English paved the way for 
the Giants’ first taily. Hustling in 
for Dick Bartell’s grounder, Woody 
unfurled a wild peg to first that not 
only missed Bartell but Camilli 
as well, the result being a hit for 
Dick, an errer for English and a 
runner on second for the Giants. 


Play at Third Fails 


Then followed another annoying 
play for the Dodgers. Jimmy Rip- 
ple dumped a sacrifice bunt which 
Mungo fielded neatly enough but 
his snap decision to try for a put- 
out at third proved ill-timed. For 
Van’s throw to English arrived too 
late and the Giants had runners on 
first and third. Oft’s infield out, 
which Johnny Hudson juggled 
around long enough to spoil for a 
double play, then sent Bartell skip- 
ping over the plate. 

In the fifth the Giants picked up 
another tally when, with one down, 
Hubbell himself set an inspiring ex-

BLOCKADE SCORES 
~ IN HUNT CLASSI 


Son of Man o’ War, Owned by 
Mrs. Beard, Wins Maryland 
Cup by Six Lengths 


By FRED VAN NESS 
Special to Tus New YorK Times. 

GLYNDON, Md., April 30.—An- 
other son of. Man o’ War, the } 
year-old Blockade, owned by Mrs. 
E. Read Beard, won glory on the 
turf today when he led all the 
way to capture the famed Maryland 
Hunt Cup amid the cheers of a 
crowd of 20,000). 

The son of Man o’ War and Rock 


Emerald finished six lengths in 
front of Mrs: Frank M. Gould’s 


Ostend. A furlong farther back was 
John Strawbridge’s Rockicy, who 
had bolted at the last jump. Last 
among the five starters was Miss 
Nancy Patterson’s Pete O’Donnell. 

J. W. Y. Martin’s Inshore, favor- 
ite at 4 to 5, fell at the ninth jump, 
was remounted and after taking the 
tenth refused the eleventh and 
went out of the race. 


Sets Mark for Event 


Blockade ran the four miles and 
took the twenty-two jumps in 8:44, 
breaking the former record of 8:51 
3-5, set by Troublemaker in 1932. 

The victor ran a great race, 


jumped faultlessly except at the 


|seventeenth, and finished so fresh 


that he was drawing away in the 
stretch after having thrown off 
three challenges ty Ostend. 

The winner was ridden by J. F. 
Colwill of Pikesville, Md., 25-year- 
old amateur, ho made an unsuc- 
cessful effort with Blockade in this 
classic last year. Colwill put up 


jan excellent and well judged ride 
| throughout. 


After the contest he 
said there was never any doubt 
about the result, barring a fall, as

out on the field, umpires raced out 
to lend assistance. Doc Painter, 
Yankee trainer, and Dr. Larkin

By JOHN KIERAN 
The Preview Motorcade, Passing Some Given Remarks 


great motorcade for the World's Fair Preview 
was massing for the start. Floats, floats and 
floats. Brass bands, jazz bands, fife and drum 
corps, gendarmes, firemen, soldiers and merry 
villagers. Four cars were in line to carry some 
notables of sport. The first to show up was Dr. 
Mal Stevens, the old Yale Blue who now coaches 
the N. Y. U. football team, 

Then there was a rush of merry villagers 
around another arrival. Jack Dempsey. He 
popped into the back seat of an open car, a brand 
new car, spick and span, glistening. The speed- 
ometer showed just twenty miles of travel. In 
exactly one minute the new car was covered with 
men, women and children trying to get Dempsey’s 
autograph. They climbed up the fenders. They 
shinnied over the radiator and tramped on the 
hood. They came in over the back of the car. 

Sleepy Jimmy Crowley, Fordham football coach 
and one of the Four Horsemen backfield of Notre 
Dame fame, suddenly appeared in the seat beside 
the driver. His hat was jammed over his eyes 
from the struggle. 

“I thought for a minute we were playing Army 
again,” said Mr. Crowley as he tried to pull him- 
self together. 

“If we don’t start soon,” said Mal 
“we'll need another car. This one 
wrecked now.” 


I’ was 9 A. M. hard by Battery Park. The

Great Writers 


Dempsey cheerfully kept on autographing ev- 
erything that was handed to him. There was a 
bicycle section of the parade near by. The riders, 
boys and girls, wore sports costumes that in- 
cluded orange caps with blue peaks. The bicycle 
section broke up to besiege Dempsey. They all 
wanted their caps autographed. That made it 
hard writing but the old Manassa Mauler obliged. 
He autographed odd bits of torn paper, business 
cards, notebooks, one driver’s license, a set of 
blueprints, a canceled check, a bass drum, a dol- 
lar bill—after first making ‘the motion of sticking 
the bill in his pocket—and an Elks membership 
card. 

There was a honking of horns and loud cheer- 
ing and the sports float drew up behind. Babe 
Ruth, in a baseball uniform, was on the front of 
the platform, a bevy of girls in sports costumes 
behind him. The Babe was autographing as in- 
dustriously as Jack Dempsey and showing more 
effects of it. Every so often he would stop writ- 
ing, take off his cap and mop his brow. 

Eddie Eagan, former Rhodes scholar and Olym- 
pic boxing champion came along with Vinnie 
Richards of tennis fame and Al Schacht, the 
Clown Prince of Baseball. Few paid any atten- 
tion to them. 

“This is an outrage,” protested Mr. Schacht. 
“We're being ignored.” 

He offered his autograph. There were no 
takers. James J. Braddock ambled up, sat in a 
car just ahead and drew another crowd of auto- 
graph-collectors. 


On the Way 


An hour passed. There was no sign of starting. 
The rush for autographs was unabated. 

“Hey!” said Dempsey, looking up from his 
writing, “when does this parade start? I gotta 
be home by Monday morning.” 

It finally started, swinging into lower Broad- 
way and turning for the northward trek through

the men in the crowd knew Jim Braddock. But 
the other riders in the sports section cars might 
as well have been clothing store dummies 

“Second-hand clothing store dummies, 
Somnolent James Crowley. 

“He's speaking for himself,’ Mal Stev- 
ens dryly, “and I think he’s boasting again 

Dr. Stevens was sitting beside Dempsey. At 
one halt a man ran out from the sidewalk to 
shake Dempsey’s hand. 

“I'm from Dallas, Texas,” 
saw you fight Firpo.” 

“Glad to see ya, pardner,

“And I'd like to shake your hand 
said the Texan, stretching his hand toward Mal 
Stevens. Then he saw his mistake and said 

“Excuse me. I thought you were Jim B:

“No, that’s my new fighter,” explai 
sey genially. “His name is Charley McCarthy.

“Look at the Babe,” said Somnolent Ja

hand motion in heaving the pasteboards that were 
fought for by the spectators along the way 

The caravan continued. The shouts and cheers 
from the sidewalk were.the same all the way to 
Columbus Circle. “Hey, Dempsey!” “There's 
Babe Ruth!” “Oh you Jack!” “Hooray for Demp- 
sey!” “Here comes the old Bambino!” Children 
were held up by their parents to see old heroes, 
Up ahead a bit there were occasional shouts for 
Jim Braddock, all male voices. The women and 
children, as well as the men and boys, recognized 
Ruth and Dempsey. But every one of the thou- 
sands of cops along the route knew Jim Braddock 
and gave him a friendly hail.

Suddenly there was a shout of “Hello

at Dr. Mal Stevens.

Larry Scanlon of Holy Cross 
turned in a 10-second performance 
to win the 100-yard dash, Irving 
Folwartshny of Rhode Island State 
gained the hammer-throwing laurels 
with a toss of 172 feet 41-3 inches, 
Ben Horowitz of Brown accounted 
for the shot-put with 48 feet 7% 
inches and Bert Litman of Harvard 
led the javelin throwers with a 
measurement of 180 feet 74 inches.

BELGIUM FOR NET CHANGE 


Backs German Proposal to Split | 
Davis Cup Competition 


| 


BRUSSELS, April 30 (P.—Bel- | 
gium’s Tennis Federation will sup- | 
port the suggestion to hold the last | 
Cup rounds bi- | 
ennially instead of annually. The 
suggestion will be made at a meet- | 
ing of the Cup nations in 
London this June 

3elzium, however, does not want | 
to eliminate all Davis Cup play 
every other year. Like Germany, 
the Belgium federation favors hold- 
ing the American European 
zone competition one year and the 
interzone final and challenge round | 
the next. 

The South African proposal, sup- | 
ported by other members of the} 
Britism Empire, is simply to cut 
out the entire competition every 
other year. It is generally believed 
both proposals will be defeated.

six furlongs, was held under restraint to the middie of the turn, came up around 
Opera Hat and, taking command in the stretch, drew out and won going away. Can't 
Wait, a bit slow to get into his stride, worked hig way up and, closing with a burst 
of speed, gained the place in the last few strides. Opera Hat had plenty of speed and 
set a fast pace put weakened in the last sixteenth. Bourbon King faltered in the fina!

field of eight to hold a length and r. oA 
a half margin over Mrs. P. Dalee 
Watt’s Busy K. at the finish of the 
mile-and-a-sixteenth contest. An- 
other half length away from first 
money came T. J. Healey’s Tatter- 
demalion. 

Installed the favorite by the crowd 
of 15,000, Burning Star ran the 
route in 1:4545 in the role of a 
$5.90-for-$2 favorite and shuffled 
into the ‘‘also ran’’ column such 
performers as Masked General, 
Isolater, Corinto and Tempestuous. 

Yhe historic race, which lost some 
caste due to the absence of War 
Admiral, suffered further loss of 
prestige when John A. Manfuso’s 
Aneroid was scratched an hour be- 
post time. Due to rain that 
marked the early stages of the pro- 
gram, the track became slow and 
Aneroid’s handlers decided to wait 
for the $20,000 added Dixie at Pim- 
lico 

Melvin Lewis, a veteran rider 
staging a comeback with the Shan- 
don Farm Stable, piloted Burning 
Star faultlessly. He allowed the colt 
to settle into his stride, saved 
winners ground wherever possible and eased 

s, fe ean H 120(Garner) 4.2 2 him up with the situation well in 
1 » 3 hand in the closing sixteenth. 

The race was worth $7,950 to the 
winner, bringing Burning Star’s 
earnings to $50,425 for two years.

GARDEN CLUBS ASSISTING 


Exhibition of a New Variety of 
Tulips From Holland to Be 
Feature of Event 


The festivity of the maiden yoy- 
age of a new transatlantic liner is 
manifest in plans for a spectacular 
flower and fashion show arranged 
for the afternoon of May 20. It wil! 
be held aboard the new flagship of 
the Holland-America Line, the 
Nieuw Amsterdam, a day or two 
after the arrival of the liner on her 
first trip here. The event has been 
arranged for the Seamen's Church 
Institute of New York. 

Special buses will leave the Hote! 
Pennsylvania to take guests by way 
of the Holland or Lincoln Tunnels 
to the Nieuw Amaeterdam's pier a' 
the foot of Fifth Street, Hoboken 

Mrs. Harold Irving Pratt and 
Mrs. E. Kirk Haskell have charge 
of the benefit and are being az- 
sisted by many members of thr 
Garden Club of America and the

| clety in the metropolitan district.

be the first demonstrative, non 
competitive show ever to be held in 
this country both for specimen 
blooms and for flower arrange 
ments. Several! thousand tulips wil! 

|be sent from Holland on the new 
ship by the Holland Tulip Grower= 
Association, and among these 
blooms will be a new variety name! 
“Princess Beatrix’’ in honor of the 
heiress to the throne of The Nether 
lands. 

The works of eighteenth centur: 
Fiemish painters have inspired th: 
exhibition of arrangements of tulip 
and other May blooms to be dis 
played by Mrs. Albert R. Benedic' 
representing the Garden Club of 
South Orange, N. J.; Mrs. John K 
Jayne, Garden Club of Nev

SCHOOLS HELD LAX. 
IN FIGHTING SLUMP 


City Federation Plans Forum 
to Show Need for Wider 
Vocational Training 


Through educational forums held 
during the club year, the New York 
City Federation of Women’s Clubs 
has become convinced that educa- 
tion met the challenge of 
the depression, according to Mrs. 
Andrew J. Noe, president of the or- 
ganization. A program designed to 
inquire into the causes of failure 
through a series of talks has been 
arranged by Mrs. Emory Holloway, 
chairman of the department of edu- 
cation, for the Spring convention 
to be held at the Hotel Astor on 
Friday 

Educators and students have been 
asked to contribute to the discus- 
sion out of which a consciousness 
of the need for wider vocational 
training will be developed, in the 
opinion of Mrs. Noe The entire 
afternoon, with the exception of a 
short musical interval, will be de- 
voted to viewing ‘‘Education for 
Tomorrow.” 

Dr. Stephen F. Bayne, associate 
superintendent in charge of ele- 
mentary education in public schools 
here, will present ‘‘Changing Con- 
cepts of Public Education,’’ while 
the role of the teacher in the 
‘School of Tomorrow” will be de- 
fined by Miss Roma Gans, associate 
in elementary education at Teach- 
ers College. Kenneth D. Benne of 
Teachers College will give the stu- 
dent’s viewpoint. 

“New Educational Opportunities 
at the American Museum of Natural 
History” will be outlined by Dr 
Charles Russell, curator of the de- 
partment of education at the 
museum, Miss Ruth Welles, a 
kraduate of the Maryland School 
for the Blind, will present a musi- 
cal program 

Dr. Harold G. Turner, president 
of the Board of Education; Dr. 
Rosella Smith, head of the visiting 
teachers department; Dr. Emory 
Holloway of Adelphi College, and 
Leroy E. Bowman of the United 
Parents Association will be guests 
of honor 

During the morning resolutions 
and reports will be considered, Pre- 
liminary to the presentation of a 
resolution covering the ‘hidden 
taxes’’ emphasized by Mrs. William 
Dick Sporborg through her work 
as chairman of legislation for the 
General Federation of Women's 
Clubs, Frank J. Arnold, a business 
man, will speak on this subject. 

Other topics, to be considered in 
resolutions presented by a commit- 
tee of which Mrs. J. Lester Lewine 
is chairman, include the regulation 
of the sale of small firearms in- 
educational facilities for 
the home-bound child and the tax-

LONG FIGHT FOR REFORMS. 


Group Has Championed Pure * ~ 
Food Laws in 25 Years of | ~ 


Militant Activity 


Twenty-five years of concentra-| 
tion on problems affecting the wel- 


| fare of the family, and the advance- 
| ment made in this field during the 


last quarter century provide the 
the Home Makers’ | 


Forum with a fund of reminiscence | 
as their silver jubilee approaches. 
Five of the charter members who 
attended the first organization 
meeting will be among the cele- 
brants of the anniversary, which 
will be observed on Thursday with 
a luncheon at the Hotel New 
Yorker. ° 

Among them are Mrs. Otto Hahn, 
its present executive head; Miss 
Helen Varick Boswell, president of 
the Woman's Forum; Mrs. Mere- 
dith Blair Lovejace, Mrs. John G. 
Murphy and Mrs. Lilly Haxworth 
Wallace. It was an invitation from 
the late Mrs. Charles D. Hirth 
which first called these women to- 
gether to ‘‘demand pure food han- 
dled under sanitary conditions, and 
full weight and measure’’ on their 
purchases. 

The name of their club until 
ten years ago was The Daily Food 
Alliance, ‘and their purpgses rap- 
idly branched into allied interests 
such as the grading of milk; pure 
food laws; the elimination of smoke 
from city atmosphere; the grading 
of meats, and the end of racketeer- 
ing among egg distributors 

Through affiliation with the Na- 
tional Consumers Federation the 
forum has attacked problems bear- 
ing on the rising cost of living. Its 
resolutions in support of the Pure 
Food, Drugs and Cosmetic Bill of 
Senator Copeland have been pre- 
sented to the New York City, State 
and General Federations; and its 
opposition to the proposed chain- 
store taxes in the bill of Senator 
Wright Patman will be placed on 
record with the City Federation at 
its convention this week. 

“‘Although the club has grown up, 
and has embraced many weighty 
problems and sponsored measures 
of national interest,'’ said Mrs. 
Hahn yesterday in reviewing the 
work of the organization, ‘‘the 
members are still home-makers in 
the old fashioned way, and _ still 
make cakes for refreshment at our 
meetings.”’ 

A symposium on 
will be presented at the anniversary 
luncheon, and new directors will 
be installed by Mrs. William Henry 
Purdy. Mrs. Wayne J. DeVyver 
is chairman of arrangements

| is convinced that an impulse for so- 
| cial betterment has motivated those 
| who have complied. 

| To date members of the New York 
| Women's Trade Union League and 


| the Consumers’ League have 


| pledged cooperation in a rearrange- * 


|ment of their laundry schedules, 
}and Mrs. Andrew J. Noe, president 
|}of the New York City Federation 
|of Women's Clubs, has the matter 
on her agenda for the convention 
this week. To such of the city clubs 
|@s emphasize the study of home 
| problems, Miss Miller has appealed 
by letter. 

| “‘Not all housewives understand 
}that this is not merely a prosaic 
|matter of soapsuds,"' Miss Miller 
said. ‘‘Back of their support of our 
;new wage regulation for laundry 
workers is an indication that they 
| Will sense the importance of other 
| regulatory measures. If the laun- 
| dries are forced to perform the bulk 
| of their work on Monday and Tues- 
day, it means that the women em- 
ployed there are not only going to 
| work the ten hours that is fixed 
; 48 an absolute maximum for a sin- 
| gle day, but that they will in many 
| cases be required to stretch that to 
{twelve hours to get the job fin- 
ished. 


Week-End Collections Urged 


| “With a little cooperation, house- 
| keepers can arrange to have their 
| bundles collected in the latter part 
jof the week and delivered on Mon 
;day. The poster which our depart 
| ment prepared to illustrate the im 
| portance of this rearrangement has 
| found its way to almost every State 
in the Union : 

“The Labor Board of the District 
of Columbia has asked for further 
information along the line of get 
| ting cooperation between the cus 
| tomer and the laundry. We are still 
}in a probationary period. As we 
round out the first half of this pe- 
riod, we see suburban women more 
jinterested in rearranging their 
| schedules than the city women ap- 
| pear to be. 

“There is a lack of uniformity in 
the attitude of the laundries, too 
While some have gone beyond our 
most sanguine hopes in the measure 
of their enthusiasm, others are in 
line for the punitive action pro 
| vided when full compliance after 
j the three-month period has been 
withheld."’ 
| Because of the imminence of regu 
latory action in other industries 
employing women, the success of 
the experiment with a law which 
substitutes compensation “adequate 
for maintenance and the protection 
of health’ for the controversiai 
“living wage,’ is being watched 
with interest 
One Brooklyn laundry whose 
| Wage schedule is above the mint 
;mum fixed by the Department of 
Labor has operated profitably, ac- 
| cording to its report, by zoning the 
;territory within which it operates 
and assigning a fixed day for col- 
lection for each zone. In Westches- 
ter, where Dudley Miller, a mem- 
ber of the Wage Board for Laundry 
Workers, is engaged in the business, 
| the women were practically unani- 
|mous in agreeing to an arbitrary 
| fixing of laundry days. 


| Results From Personal Appeal 
| “T wrote a@ personal letter to every 
customer,’" Mr. Miller explained, 
“telling her that the new wage scale 
would necessitate a distribution of 
the work throughout the week I 
have not had a single complaint 
| Before the new regulations were im- 
| posed I had made it a practice to 
encourage end-of-the-week collec 
tion by making a reduction of 2 


| cents @ pound for one type of work.

IANT prints, columnar slim- 
ness, Wedgwood daintiness, 
corseted waistline, rhumba 
ruffles, strapless-shoulder al- 
tailored dinner chic—what 
more diversified spread of ideas 
could one desire’ All are present 
in evening clothes. Dining formally 
in the breeze-swept open of a sky 
restaurant, you wear a high-necked 
gown slightly flavored with a 
piquant Gibson-girl air; dancing 
over the spacious ballroom floor of 
country club or private home, you 
look your loveliest in a full-ekirted 
gown whose  horsehair-stiffened 
hem undulates gracefully as you 
whirl. 

What a time it is to set off one's 
best points! The small-of-the-waist 
should offer a prayer of thankagiv- 
ing to those who resuscitated the 
hour-glass look; it has been many 4 
year since one could confidently 
brag of a spanable circumference. 
Several of those wizards overseas 
seemed to have got the idea simul- 
taneously, the credit being laid 
chiefly at the door of Chanel and 
Lelong. Now many a grand crea- 
tion has a concealed boned section 
at the waist. It holds you in; it 
gives you «@ firm curved look; it 
promises you marked distinction in 
contrast to those of greater girth. 


Strapless Shoulders 


OINT number two to be taken 
into consideration 
looking pair of shoulders. Now 

is the time to show them off. It is 
safe to say that, especially among

|with the flesh-tinted embroidered |

tics holding the bands that cross 
the top of the arms. 


In direct contrast to such display 
of shoulders is the concealment of 
the neck under a fragile covering of 
This one finds in formal din- 
ner gowns, which also in a mild | 
way recall a past generation. 
(What extremes of modesty and 
revelation those ladies of a few dec- 
ades ago could go to!) One of the 
most prominent among New York | 
designers puts a yoke of lace on 
the top of a slim crépe dress; she | 
makes them both in black, or, as 
illustrated here, she daringly tops 
a gown of white wtih a yoke of 
black Chantilly. 


lace. 


We can't leave the subject of in- 
spiration derived from yesterday's 
styles without mention of the use 
of narrow insertions of lace set in 
like the fine threads of a spider's 
web. Do you remember them on 
your own first party frock, the one 
of sheer muslin, or on your mother's 
more formal gown of taffeta’? If 
so, take a look at the pink mar- | 
quisette sketched and thrill to find 
the past so enticingly translated 
into the present. 


Then there's the picture gown 
that smacks of the beruffled loveli- 
ness of Mrs. Siddons, which, also, 
because of its clever handling, is 
taking its place normally in a mod-| 
ern setting. No doubt it may find 
itself seated side by side at a party 
with rhumba flounces—the popular- 
ity of the dance for which they are 
named and the increased interest in| 
Caribbean cruising will not let 
them die. 

Never have we seen such yrs

larged to eight or ten times their 
normal size—great sheaths of wheat 
or branches of laure! leaves. Only 
the tall should venture to wear 
them, but they are striking for the | 
right person.

the gardening hobby was first chal-

(even though the dwellings now 
shelter several families) and where 
many residents still like to work in 
their flower plots. 

Residents of the section who own 
country places entered actively into 
the project of making gardens 
available in town—perhaps because 
they know how delightful a pastime 

| gardening is. They joined the Little |

which presently formed the center 
and which has itself had a some-

| It happened that, unknown to the 
| Little Gardens Club, the university 
was preparing some garden courses | 
|in response to popula’ demand. Dr. | 
| Chase, therefore, was interested in| 
|the suggestion, and the School of | 
Adult Education through Dr. H. H. 

Sheldon extended assistance to the | 
club. ' 


laid before! 


on Monday, Wednesday and Friday 
afternoons when she is ready to 
answer all fnquiries relative to gar- 
' den problems, without charge to the 
inquirer. A small library of gar- 


‘den books is also open to readers. 


Apart from her regular duties, Mrs. | 


| Haas is giving a series of garden 
talks. In many instances the same 
topic is discussed with two differ- 
ent groups—once for adults, and 
again for children. The schools of 


|the section have shown interest. | 


Their cooperation is expected. 
Activities of the sort indicated by 


no means limit the scope of the/| 


Garden Center. As the project 
grows, other activities will be 
added. It is hoped that nature 
walks for children and adults can 
be arranged for Spring and Sum- 
mer, as well as a study of conser- 
vation, birds, landscaping and, in 
fact, all that promotes or contrib- 
utes to a love of nature among both 
children and ‘‘grown-ups.” 


FIRST PINK BUDDLEIA 
AMONG THE NOVELTIES 


Sweetest, pinkest, fastest grow- 
ing, and by name charming, is the 
buddleia introduced this year. Al- 
though the long flower spikes still 
have a tinge of lavender, they are 


‘ing being advertised as the first 
| pink buddleia. 

This ‘‘butterfly bush,’’ with its 
graceful sprays of flowers and the 
bright visitors that gave it its com- 
mon name, has always been a pop- 
ular shrub. Buddleia Charming is 


|marked as an outstanding novelty 


of i938. In fact, it has already 
been awarded a silver medal by the 
Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

Young plants of Charming will 
flower abundantly during the first 
Summer. The growers suggest that 
the first flowers in July be pinched 


in the garden of Mrs. Adam Luke. 
... Mrs. Robert C. Green of White 
Plains will lecture on ‘‘Herbs'’ be- 
fore the Lake Mahopac Garden Club 
jon Tuesday at 2:30. Mrs. M. C. 
|Lorini is hostess. There will be a

It has now been shown that the 


-» Miss | lycopods also have such an associa- 


| tion, the mycelium of a fungus hav- 
ing been found in practically all 
| regions of the plants other than the | 
}actual growing points of the roots’ 
and stems. The identity of this | 


| cungus has not, as yet, been ascer- | 


2 


informal ‘tained, but its presence is doubtless | 


of value to the plant in securing 
| certain nutriments, such aq sugars, 
;and the relationship is most cer-. 
tainly an obligate one, at least un- 
der natural outdoor conditions. 
Some of the Club Mosses are typ- 
,ieally woodland plants, preferring | 
partial shade and average moisture | 
conditions. Those of importance for | 
| Christmas ‘“‘greens,"’ however, are! 
often found in dry, open pastures. 
Although listed as subacid soil 
plants, there is apparently much | 
variation as to soil acidity. A recent | 
worker suggests that ‘‘a mixture of 
| Peat, sand, leaf mold and soil 
proved fairly satisfactory” for their 
cultivation. 
| At present it is impossible to grow 
lycopods from the spores. Labora- 
tory experiments have resulted in 
but little success and the whole 
process of spore germination and) 
development of the prothalli is high- | 
ly involved and in need of much 
further study. |

pends to a large extent upon the | down a little nearer to the scope of 


sort of edging plants used. In 
Spring and early Summer low-grow- 
ing varieties along the outer line 
enhance the effect of exuberant, 
blossoming beds. But in midsum- 
mer when heat and drought take 
toll. during part of Autumn and in- 
variably in Winter it is upon the 
character of edging plants that the 


good looks of the garden stand or | 


fall 

As to what qualities the ideal 
edging plant should posseas, the 
conclusions of the experienced are 
that for forma! layouts it should be 
evergreen and of neat growth, 
either naturally or through possihle 
shearing. In borde?fs a prolonged 
and charming flowering habit is a 
further desirable asset, and to this 
beauty the evergreen quality may 
be sacrificed provided the blossom- 
ing subject is of good tendency of 
growth from early Spring through 
Fall. It must never be a straggier 
nor present that tired appearance 
of Phiox canadensis as the season 
advances. 

For formal layouts the most pleas- 
ing evergreen binding is dwarf 
box (Buxus sempervirens suffrut!- 
cona) For those sections where 
it will go safely through the Win- 
ter without requiring burlap wrap- 
pings or some unsightly type of 
sunshade, dwarf boxwood has no 
equal. This box need not be con- 
sidered too expensive. Propagation 
of a long row of plants can be un- 
dertaken from cuttings, with the 
expectation of a well developed root 
system (of at least the size of an 
egg) within six weeks if the pieces 
are first soaked in one of the root- 
forming hormone substances. 

Three Other Evergreen Edgings 

Where some other evergreen bor- 
der plant seems more practical, 
there are three to consider: german- 
der, ivy 
Japanese Holly

je shrubby, with stems twelve to 
fifteen inches high, and rosy blooms

In maturity, germander 
like dwarf boxwood, is 
perfectiy hardy and particularly 
adapted to a light, sandy soil. It

Cuttings develop rapidly in sand 
if planted in Spring and grown on 
in light shade through the Summer

tion. Ivies attractive, 


green beds of 


or one of the varieties of | 


\the average purse. It is so like the 
| 

ideal dwarf box that it is often mis- 
taken for it. It will endure extreme 
cold with complete nonchalance, 
| meeting the Spring each year with- 
out the tell-tale yellow streaks of 
|Winter injury that are so dis- 
| treasing when they appear on cher- 
ished boxwood. 


Stressing Color 

The informal edging, stressing 
color more than form, offers a 
| greater choice of subjects, though 
|} not so wide as may first be sup- 
posed if the gardener 
| strictly to the essential quality of 
|neatness through all the growing 
season. Plants often recommended 
—but far better avoided or else rele- 
gated to the inner line of bedding— 
|are the spindly Persian stonecress, 
| the common looking Geneva bugle, 
forget-me-not anchusa (A. myosoti- 
flora) which is on the coarse side 
as to leaves, and white fan colum- 
bine and fringed bleeding heart, 
both of which go shabby in Sum- 
mer, and that very dull but still 
used subject, catmint. Violas would 
jbe perfect if they ecdhid develop 
| heat resistance. The charming iris 
| cristata doesn't line up well at all. 

The writer's first choice for the 
not too formal garden is definitely 
hardy candytuft, either the 12- 
inch Iberis sempervirens or smaller 
varieties like Little Gem and Snow- 
flake. These are a never-failing 
source of beauty the year around. 
In Winter the iberis itself requires 
no covering (it is lovely with a 
powdering of snow), but it is tall 
and of such wiry habit that it is 
useful as a “retaining wall’’ for

The Amenable Coral Bell 


Heuchera, or coral bell, blooming 
(late May through June), is 
to sun or shade, and 
thrives in a moist, rich loam. Plant- 
ings in atiff clay soils are rarely 
satisfactory. The airy bells are pro- 
duced on tall stems which rise from 
low, evergreen crowns of geranium- 
like leaves. In Winter these are 
pleasant, bronzy tones. For the 


later

writer the older Heuchera sangul- | 
nea has bloomed better than the) 


new Rosamunde. Perry's White and 
Pluie de Feu are also recommended 
varieties 

The grass- or clove-pinks (Dian- 
thus plumarius) with uniformly neat 
rray-green foliage, make charming 
hems for borders. Their spicy scent 
lends additional value when the

PLANTINGS ARE HURRIED | 


Seed Sowing in the Open Goes On, But Tender | 
Plants Can Wait a Bit Longer | 


By F. F. ROCKWELL 
| With the temperature vagaries of 


rm very erratic Spring apparently 
|over, and the weather, at least for 
| the present, a bit more settled, gar- 
deners are hastening to finish their 
jearly planting, and are putting in 
| some of the ‘‘tender’’ seeds. In fact, 
in sectiona where apples are in 
| bloom and the oak leaves well 
| started, there is little risk with any 
seeds, as the danger of a late frost 
will be slight by the time they have 
poked their noses above ground. 
| With plants to be set out—such as 
| tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, dahlias 
and cannas—the case is somewhat 
| different, as they are immediately 
exposed to frost danger. Therefore 
it is just as well to go a bit slow 
with these. Experienced growers, 
however, give these plants special 
|attention at this season by putting 
j}them through a “hardening off"’ 
process. They are given all the 
fresh air and direct sunshine possi- 
ble by leaving the frames in which 
they are growing uncovered, even 
at night, unless there is danger of 
actual frost. 
Ready to Set Out 

Such hardening gets the plants in 
condition to withstand their trans- 
fer to the open with a minimum of 
shock. When they are moved di- 
rectly from the greenhouse or the 
house, or even from a covered cold 
frame, directly to the open, they 
are almost certain to suffer severely 
even under the most favorable con- 
ditions. This is the cause of partial 
or complete failure with many 
plants—including ‘‘green’’ plants of 
dahlias—bought from seedsmen or 
growers who have grown them 
under glass. 

Among all the Summer flowering 
bulbs none is better suited to give 
a long season of blooms for cutting

CARE NEEDED AFTER TRANSPLANTING 


Even the best of care in 
digging a large part of the 
system is destroyed when any tree 
or shrub is transplanted There- 
fore the top should be pruned to re- 
the balance Frequently a 
third to a half of the buds can be 
removed without injuring the shape 
of the tree. A thickly branched tree 
should be thinned throughout, leav 
ing the branches well distributed 
along the trunk. Some of the longer 
branches may be shortened. The 
leader should be retained to make « 
straight trunk. One of each pair 
of branches forming a weak V- 
shaped fork should be removed or 
shortened. Shrubs are pruned by 
removing the older stems and short- 
ening the remaining ones 

A transplanted tree or shrub must 
secure iis water from a very smal! 
volume of soil, until the root sye- 
fem is renewed. For this reason 
the moisture supply is easily ex- 
hausted Artificial watering is 
essential if abundant rains do not 
occur. The sofl should be left to 
form a “saucer” over the roots,

The most vexing problem in the) 
trees, | 


after care of transplanted 
large or small, is that of borer con- 
trol Most boring insects prefer 
trees which are in low vitality as 
transplanted trees are the first year 
or two. The most effective preven- 
tive is wrapping the trunk or larger 
branches with burlap strips or nur- 
wtry wrapping paper to keep up the 
moisture content of the wood, since 
the borers prefer to feed in dry sap- 
wood. Two boards nailed to form 


a V and fastened on the southwest 
side of the trunk will discourage at- 
some of the flat-headed | 


tack by 
borers 
In the Autumn, before frost, the 
basin about the tree should be filled 
im and the soil mounds moistened 
and mulched. Then the trans- 
planted tree is off to « good start 


at the end of its first and most 
critical season.

Forsythias Are Pruned 


The ideal time for pruning for- 
sythias is just after the flowers fade. 
They may be left until later, but all 
new growth that is made in the, 
meantime, and cut away later, 
means just that much wasted ef: | 
fort on the part of the plant. 

Much of the beauty of the for- 
sythia lies in its gracefully arch- 
ing, slender branches, and this nat- 
ural habit of the plant must be re- 
tained if it is to show at its best 
for another season. Hence in prun- 
the object should be to cut

national short-story con- 
test, and this is her first , novel. 
These facts are mentioned at the 
beginning of a review of her 
book because they are of perti- 
nent interest. “Rachel's Chil- 
. éren” is « very fine piece of work 
“ to come from a young and inex 
~ pertenced author. Although it is 
a achieved by youth, its subject 
E scarcely touches youth and all its 
a people are worn and burt by life, 
: not fresh and ardent; and in spite 
a of inexperience Miss Hassell hes 
had the courage to attack two of 
the oldest and most * difficult 
problems in life and literature 
4 and the skill to carry through her 
attack with force and originality 
es well as passion and sincerity 
and thought. She has brought to 
her work, moreover, « certain 
petural audacity: her story and 
her people are set before us with 
a kind of fierce concentration.

gie of the characters makes the 
whole of the novel. There is some 
description, but it is of small de- 
tails, and almost symbolic; the 


anywhere. 
It is an immensely ambitious 


Haseell’s performance is in itself 
to pay tribute to the large meas 


think, a born novelist, and this 
not only because she writes well 


she is an artist first; she will be 


of Democracy in 


Ruskin. He does not think that 
Arnold’s travels on the Continent 


, brought close contact with com- 


It seems rather that 
Arnold came back imbued with 
enthusiasms for Prussian educa- 


: tion and for “State action,” both 


of which led him to denunciation 
of the evils of “democracy” and 
“equality” as practiced by Eng- 
lish middle-class governments. 


* arnold saw that the middle class 


had fattened on laissez-faire, and 
that they consequently deplored 
State action. But this attitude, 


. ture.” 


Hitler is a fair example of one 
of Arnold’s modern disciples. (He 
used the same terms with strong- 
er effect at Nuremberg.) But the 
word democracy i# subtie; cape- 
ble of many uses; and it is evi- 
dent that clarifying interpreta- 
tions are necessary, even for our 


- guthor. 


Sir Henry Maine prophesied 
that democracy in the Western 


- World would soon be superseded 
- by dictatorships. Out of Victorian 


democracy he envisaged ® grow- 
ing autocracy on the part of the 
English Cabinet—abie to ride 
roughshod over an ignorant House 
of Commons, and to exercise, 
eventually, full powers over & 
Constitution 
that did not have legal checks 
and balances wisely provided, as 
in its American counterpart. It 
seems that his prophecies, oo, 


- are being borne out for those who 


watch & “theoretically all-power- 
ful” legislative body being told 
(or not told) what the govern- 
ment is doing by & “practically

Book REVIEW, May !. 1938. 


Harriet Hassell. 


- more fully a craftsman later. Her 
- events are sometimes too clearly 
- modeled, as if too definitely ar- 


ranged; her characters for the 
most part are not quite clear 
enough. But it is precisely be- 


, cause James is so sinister that 


one wishes an explanation for his 
possession by evil; it is precisely 


all-powerful secret Committee of 
Public Safety.” 

Space here permits no full dis- 
cussion of these interesting Eng- 
lish prophets of democratic catas- 
trophe. Yet it is significant that 
their writings have been known 
only too well to that small élite 
which has slowly been forming an 
English “governing class.” And it 
is not without significance that 
300,000 copies of Carlyle’s writ- 
ings were purchased by German 
readers alzo during the six years 
immediately preceding the “Na- 


- tional Resurrection.” 


The six prophets and historians 
here treated were not isolated 
middle-class thinkers, as the au- 


- thor states. Compared with Plato 


or Aristotle, Berkeley or Locke, 
Kant or Spinoza, they led furious 
lives and knew all sorts of men. 
Some of them came from poor 
environments; all knew struggle. 
At least three warned against 
the menace of “americanization” 
in industry. They did not favor 
“hereditary aristocracies” a8 the 
author seems to infer, but rather 
“aristocracies” of merit and of 


talent. But Professor Lippincott .. 


may be right when he intimates 
that as a group they may be en- 
visioned as the advance guard of 
a British National Socialism. It 
is even possible that they may 
become intellectual heroes for the 
next generation. Meanwhile, it 
behooves a somnolent democratic 
world to beware. It is not with- 
out significance that only two 
adequate biographies of these 
eminent figures have appeared in 
English, Hobeon's on Ruskin, 
Neff's on Carlyle, both largely 
unread. 

Another prominent Victorian 
early became & disciple of Car- 


because Martha and Kate are 
suggested with reality, and be- 
cause Jahn and Sue are impor- 
tant, that one wants a less 
shadowy portraiture. Rachel and 
what happens to her one will not 
forget. In this tragic story there 
are pressing interest and a great 
promise. 


Victorian England 


aire class, boasting & coat of 
arms when he went up to Oxford, 
this man later turned against 
democracy and also against in- 
tensified State action. He showed 
that a man might be @ “practi- 
cal” reformer—far different from 


as Engiand’s most important con- 
tribution to nineteenth-century 
thought. So Morris might have 
made a seventh prophet 

But Professor Lippincott has 
performed “a good turn of work” 


those on top of the world may 
successfully continue to throw 
their bread upon the waters. He 
shows how such measures induce 
cancers in the body politic. 


Chattanooga, Tenn., announce 
that they will publish, on or about 
May 1, “Old Frontiers,” by John 
P. Brown. This is the story of 
the Cherokee Indians from ear- 
Hest times to the date of their 
removal to the West in 1838.

long to 1928 and 1929, while “The 
Comforter,” which embodies Miss 
Holtby’s deeply religious convic- 
tions and her unassuming beauty 
of character, is Gated not long 
before her death. 

For dessert—though you must 
search about in the book for them 
—you have the most hilarious of 
all the stories, ‘ 


Hilary,” or the slighter but hardly 
leas humorous “Facilis Descensus 
Averni"; and for liqueur with 
your coffee you can enjoy the de- 
licious guying of the sophisticates

A perfect menu, about which we 
can have but one regret—that 
Winifred Holtby is not here to be

BERLIN. 

Ts long-drawn-out war be- 

tween energetic anti am- 

bitious little Japan and the 

ancient, tattered giant 
China naturally turns the atten- 
tion of Europe as well as of 
America more than ever toward 
those Far Eastern countries. And 
literature likes to find new 
themes in places that hold the in- 
terest of the world. 

Two books on Peiping that 
merit special note have recently 
been published in Germany. They 
are “Peking: Der Leere Thron,”

sisting upon and emphasizing 
this point. Taking sharp issue 


~ with I. A. Richards, who believes 


York: The Macmillan Con:- 
pany. $2.50. 

OW and then the question 
arises whether any discus- 
sion of the philosophy of 

poetry is valuable other than in 


- a theoretical way; whether the 


reader's appreciation of poetry, 
or the author's ability to create 
it, has ever been improved in 
even the slightest degree by all 
the painstaking analyses of the 
nature, function and psycholog- 


- ical import of the poetic act and 


impulse. Whatever one may have 
to say on this subject—and cer- 
tainly there are grounds for 
holding that a philosophical) diag- 


- mosis of poetry, like the philo- 


sophical diagnosis of a sunset, 


- may destroy the very essence of 


that which is inspectea—one will 
bardly be likely to clash sabers 
with G. Rostrevor Hamilton, since 
it is this writer's contention that 
the value of a poem is in the 
poem itself and cannot be sought 
in any significance it may have 
in the other relations of human 
life. 

Throughout ail! his chapters 
Mr. Hamilton is contiqually in- 


poetry to be bound up with the 
unconscious impuises of the nerv- 
ous system, the critic maintains 
that poetry is “of value for the 
quality of the conscious experi- 
ence it gives”; that its usefulness 
and its aim are to be found in 
itself exclusively; that the experi- 
ence we undergo in reading and 
enjoying a poem is to be trusted, 
and is to be regarded as an end 
in itself; and that the function of 
poetry is neither to convey social 
philosophies nor to communicate 
scientific discoveries, but merely 
to make the contents of the 
poet’s aesthetic consciousness 
perceptible and real to the con- 
sciousness of the reader. This is, 
in fact, to say no more than most 
of us assume as a matter of com- 
mon sense; but it is nevertheless 
to say something that requires to 
be said, since the theorists have 
a habit of fogging the issue and 
wandering so far adrift that the 
reader begins to suffer from a 
sense of vertigo. 

It must not be assumed, how- 
ever, that Mr. Hamilton does not 
take account of the technica! skill 
of the poet in conveying his expe- 
rience to the reader; he specifi- 


cally calls attention to the effect 
of a metrical arrangement of 
words in producing ‘a unified 
contemplative experience’; and 
he maintains that the poet, in 
the very act of composition, cre- 
ates an experience which he com- 
municates to others. At this 
point, it may be suspected, he 
treads on questionable ground, 
and gives undue credit to the 
mere act of striking words to- 
gether; and he is likewise on 
very doubtful territory when he 
looks exclusively to ‘the final 
experience which the poem pro- 
duces” in order to determine “to 
what extent its emotion is seri- 
ous, or its technique good.” Is 
this not an impossible test, since 
no poem ever written has pro- 
duced precisely the same “final 
experience” in any two minds?” 
It would not be well, however, to 
quarrel too sharply with Mr. 
Hamilton over these and, other 
points; for the book, whatever 
the doubts it may awaken and 
the obscurities it may leave un- 
dissipated, constitutes ga thought- 
ful addition to the library of re- 
cent poetic discussion, and one 
which strives stoutly for eman- 
cipation from the fetters of much 
loose and misieadmg thinking.

lin), and “Die Purpurne Stadt,” 
@ novel by Ilse Langner (S. 
Fischer, Berlin). 

Ernst Cordes, whose father 
took over the duties of the mur- 
dered German envoy during the 
Boxer Rebellion, is thoroughly 
familiar with the remarkable 
capital city of China. His vivid 
yet objective description, supple- 
mented by a map, shows us that 
actually three cities make up this 
centuried capital which used to 
be the seat of the self-styled 
“rulers of the world.” Mr. Cordes 
has succeeded in presenting the 
plan of the city most clearly. For 
Peiping is no mere huge settle- 
ment that has gradually reached 
its great size. It was built up in 
accordance with a set plan prob- 
ably unparalleled anywhere else 
in the world in unjty and archi- 
tectural magnificence. 

The Chinese City, the Tartar 
City and the forbidden Imperial 
City in the middle are surrounded 
by enormous walls that are the 
work of centuries and that were 
always considered invincible—al- 
though this view has had to be 
abandoned after the onslaughts 
of the last war and its modern 
artillery. Mr. Cordes leads us into 
exotic places, shows us the most 
incredible customs and practices 
of the Chinese people. Much of 
this is repulsive, much proves dis- 
appointing, some things amuse 
us—but Cordes, in any case, finds 
his experiences wholly delightful. 
His book is an interesting, even 
gripping account of a world for- 
eign to us. It does not, however, 
delve into the profundities of 
ancient Chinese philosophy.

LSE LANGNER is a new- 

comer to the literary world. 

Three plays of hers have al- 
ready been produced in Berlin—a 
measure of success only very 
rarely achieved by a woman. Her 
first novel, “Die Purpurne Stadt "’ 
reveals great poetic qualities. It 
‘tells the story of a modern Ger- 
man girl, Gloria Raschfal, whose 
grandfather sends her to Peiping 
to join his brother there; he is to 
initiate her into the wisdom of the 
Far East. She, however, finds 
that he has become a Christian 
saint who has left the career of 
a missionary for that of a physi- 
cian and has placed himself 
wholly at the disposal of the 
poorest of the poor. 

Over this straightforward Ger- 
man girl the storm of a great 
passion now breaks. Enchanting 
pages depict her love for a Ger- 
man adventurer who, long an 
outcast from European society, 
lives a completely Chinese life 
with two native women. Uniquely 
and fascinatingly the author 
weaves the threads of events into 
a colorful web of artistry. Moving 
and melodramatic scenes follow 
one another, fantastic and yet 
realistic too. Despite the magic 
spell to which she almost suc- 
cumbs, the German girl keeps a 
firm hold on herself and main- 
tains the inviolability of her char- 
acter. But the two Europeans 
who love her—the German adven- 
turer and a Dutch rubber mag- 
nate—are seized with overwhelm- 
ing nostalgia, and in order to win 
her are ready to give up the 
careers they have so boldly and 
dangerously built for themselves 
in the East. 

For the German adventurer it

By EDWARD LAROCQUE TINKER 


NE evening in 1846, Jesse 

Little, wide-hatted, long- 

bearded and clothed in 

black, called at the home 
of Federal Judge Kane in Phila- 
delphia. He was an elder of the 
Mormon Church and had stopped 
over on his way to Washington to 
discuss asking government aid 
for the Latter-day Saints in their 
projected trek across the conti- 
nent. The judge’s son, a young 
lawyer, Thomas Leiper Kane, was 
present and listened with grow- 
ing sympathy as Elder Little re- 
counted the persecutions of his 
people. 

Driven from pillar to post by 
those who difftred from their 
creed and were envious of their 
prosperity, the Mormons had fi- 
nally settled at Nauvoo, I1l., 
where they built d*fiourishing 
town with a marble temple. Con- 
verts from Europe and the New 
England States increased their 
population until their voting pow- 
er became so substantial that 
both political parties bid for it 
with legislation granting them 
practical autonomy and a militia 
of their own-—the Nauvoo Legion. 
Joseph Smith, their leader, intox- 
icated with success, threw his hat 
in the ring in 1844 for the Presi- 
dency of the United States, and 
when the Nauvoo Expositor at- 
tacked him editorially, he ruth- 
lessly confiscated the press. This 
aroused the already existing ani- 
mosity of the non-Mormon popu- 
lation to a white heat and mat- 
ters went from bad to worse. 
Smith and his brother were 
lodged in jail at Carthage and fi- 
nally shot, and later Nauvoo was 
attacked and riddied with more 
than a ton of cannon balls. The 
Mormons fled across the river 
and were at Council Bluffs, living 
miserably in inadequate tents, 
short of food, clothes and all 
other necessaries. Brigham 
Young, who had become their 
Spiritual and temporal chief after 
the death of Smith, wished to 
lead them to a new haven in the 
West where they might follow 
the tenets of their faith undis- 
turbed. 

Young Kane, moved by this 
story of persecution, determined 
to champion the Mormons, and, 
in 1847, set out for Council 
Bluffs. 


*ess8 

7 pers later his private pa- 
pers and diaries came into 
the possession of the Leland 
Stanford University and Profes- 
sor Oscar Osburn Winther edited 
those that concerned the adven- 
tures with the Latter-day Saints 
and published them in “A Friend 
of the Mormons.” (Gelber-Lilien- 
thal Company, 336 Sutter Street, 
San Francisco, $4.50.) The edi- 
tion, printed at the Grabhorn 

Preas, is limited to 500 copies. 
His letters, diaries, reports and 
some of the official correspond- 
ence from the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs at Washington 
have been cleverly arranged to 
give a running account of Kane's 
experiences. On the way to Coun- 
cil Bluffs he went through Nau- 
voo and describes the town with 
its houses and farms deserted ex- 
cept for a band of armed men 
who had taken over the marble 
temple in which to stage their 
drunken orgies. When he reached 
the Mormon encampment he 

found great distress and need. 
Kane pled the Mormon cause 
in Washington and described how 
20,000 of them were in motion 
with their sick, their children and 
their aged, traveling among our 
most warlike Indians in the most 


May 1, 19348 


difficult and wild parts of our 
country. He insisted they were a 
fine people and said they were 
capable “of exercising an appre- 
ciable influence upon the national 
welfare. Their men are careful 
agriculturists or skilled artisans 
educated chiefly in Great Britain 
or the Atlantic States of the 
North—hardy, enterprising and 
industrious as a matter of reli- 
gion as well as habit.” He com- 
pared them with “the gentlemen 
immigrant from the frontiers of 
Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, ama- 
teurs of scalping, gouging and 
the use of the Bowie knife.” 

os eee 

OME years later Kane again 

played a leading part in Mor- 

mon affairs. In the mean- 
time Brigham Young had reached 
Salt Lake and founded a strong 
and successful colony. This he 
had accomplished by an auto- 
cratic, intelligent dictatorship 
that was in form a religious to- 
talitarian State. With their dif- 
ferent ideology, customs and re- 
ligious beliefs the Mormons had 
again stirred up animosity with 
their neighbors and Young’s ap- 
pointment as first Governor of 
the Territory only served to fur- 
ther inflame the other settlers 
that had come into Utah. The 


Otherwise 


de France” is traced the history 
of the French people from an 
apocryphal Trojan descent to the 
death of Charies VII in 1461. 
These manuscript records were 
printed in Paris fifteen years 
later and was the first known 
volume in France to bear a date. 

Soon afterward there flourished 
in “La Ville Lumiére” a master 
illuminator, Antoine Vérard, a 
man of impeccable taste and 
great business initiative. He was 
a successful printer, woodblock 
cutter and bookseller. Macfariane 
lists 253 books he published, al- 
though in only twenty-eight of 
them is the statement actually 
made that he was the printer. His 
noble patrons were accustomed 
to the beautiful monk-painted 
miniatures and decorations of the 
medieval manuscripts, so to sat- 
isfy their tastes Vérard designed 
and cut fine woodblocks to deco- 
rate his publications. Indeed it 
was Vérard and a few of his con- 
temporaries who achieved the ex- 
quisite harmony and sympathy 
between type and illustrations 
that was a salient characteristic 
of French printing in the fif- 
teenth century. 


ERARD saw commercial | 


possibilities ‘in “Les 
Grandes Chroniques de 


- France” and had them reprinted 


pointed Alfred Cummings Gover- 
nor to replace Brigham Young 
and sent him to Utah backed by 
a detachment of Federal troops 
under General Albert Sidney 
Johnston. 

Young refused to resign and 
the Mormons were on the point 
of clashing with the United States 
troops, when Kane arrived after 
a hard journey across Panama 
and up the West Coast. His old 
friendship with the Mormons 
stood them in good stead for 
Kane persuaded Young to resign 
his office and avert bloodshed. 

“A Friend of the Mormons” is 
an intimate, interesting account 
of a sect that through industry, 
discipline and faith arrived at a 
solution of its people’s problems 
in spite of hardships and persecu- 
tion. 


se ¢ 
N the early days the medieval 
monasteries were islands of 
learning in a great sea of 
ignorance, and it was the monks 
who kept the record of historical 
events. This was especially true 
of the Abbey of St. Denis, where, 
at the death of a French monarch, 
some friar was chosen to compile 
an account of the principal events 
of his reign. In the “Chroniques 


in 1493 in a _ beautiful three- 
volume edition with many fine 
woodcuts designed (and probably 
cut) by him. This set is now 
exceedingly rare — only thirteen 
are known to exist, two of which 
are in this country. 

Part of the “Chroniques” was 
devoted to an extended account of 
the exploits of Jeanne d’Arc, 
written by the monk Jean Char- 
tier. His narrative is particular- 
ly significarft, for he died about 
1462, so it must have been com- 
pleted within thirty years of “The 
Maid’s” death, when the events 
were still fresh in many minds. 
This portion of “The Chronicles” 
has been translated by Pauline B. 
Sowers and published under the 
name“Joan, the Maid of Orleans” 
(Roy Vernon Sowers, 117 Mont- 
gomery Street, San Francisco, 
$6.), with a bibliographical note 
on Antoine Vérard by Mr. Sow- 
ers. It is printed at the Grabhorn 
Press in Koch Bible Gothic, a 


type that is in perfect harmony | 
with the reproductions of wood- | 
cuts from the Vérard edition, | 
which serve as illustrations, and | 


there is a medieval] touch of color 


in the red chapter headings and | 
the blue or red initial letters. All | 


in all, it is a handsome and well- 
realized piece of period printing. 
The edition is limited to 525 
copies.

is impossible to break completely 
the innumerable ties that bind 
him to China. Furthermore, he 
knows very well that in Europe 
he can find no future. For Gloria, 
however, nothing counts but Ger- 
many. And so at the last moment, 
just as they are about to run 
away together, they part forever. 
But the Dutch rubber magnate 
makes the great sacrifice of giv- 
ing up all his connections. He 
wins the girl, and returns with 
her to her German home. 

In this book Ilse Langner re- 
veals the ability to bring out the 
uncanny and yet fabulous beauty 
of China so vividly that we seem 
to see the characters and scenes 


with our own eyes. Yet a mist of 
fantasy gives an air of unreality 
to the whole.

Railroad Fantasy 

7:58. By Phil 
Stong. IUustrated by Lois 
Lenski. 101 pp. New York: 
Farrar & Rinehart. $1.50. 
When, after years of tardiness, 

Edgar the train rebelled against 


scheduled, the shock to the Pitts- 
ville citizens was as nothing to 


nature and, if crossed, he was 
sure to be grouchy. Edgar was 
determined to be known as the 
7:58, and if balked he simply laid 
his own tracks in the air. 

This habit, disconcerting st 
first, proved to be both diverting 


" and informative to the crew, for 


Edgar was not above a bit of 


for a moment does the illusion 
give way to the commonplace, 
even though the characters and 
dialogue smack familiarly of 
rural America. Much of the hu- 
mor, it is true, springs from an 
adult knowledge of the congru- 
ous, just as the allusions are 
adult allusions, yet the essential 
framework of the story is one to 
delight children who have not yet 
become reconciled to the natural 
laws. Edgar, wrangling with his 
irresponsible henchmen, growing 
more crochety and dictatorial 
every minute, is a real person- 
ality. Lois Lenski in her char- 
acteristic style has accorded him 
that honor in her illustrations. 


The Gardener’s Saint 


LITTLE PATRON OF GAR- 
DENERS. The Good Saint 
Fiacre. By Catherine Beebe. 
IUustrated by Robb Beebe. 38 
pp. New York: Longmans, 
Green & Co. $1. 


It was a happy thought to 
bring out this life of St. Fiacre 
in the Spring of the year, for 


found his chance to become a real 
artist is the basis for Mrs. Si- 
mon’s picture of Mexican village 
life. 

It is true that Mrs. Simon ap- 
pears to have an authentic, even 
an intimate, knowledge of that 
life, and her story will bring to 
children of the eight-to-eleven 
age a colorful picture of fiestas, 
ceremonies and the daily round of 
living, yet it is somehow lacking 
in the warmth, the third-dimen- 
sional quality which character- 
ized her former books. Those 
stories of the Ozarks were as in- 
digenous and flavorsome as corn- 
pone, while this remains for all 
its color and kindliness simply a 
good story of a foreign land. That 
setting has provided Howard Si- 


«ven if his festival is celebrated § 
| during the harvest time it is at 


this season that the thoughts of 
devout gardeners must turn most 
hopefully to their patron saint. 
This volume, the second in a 
series of Lives of the Saints writ- 
ten for children of the elementary 
grades, and in particular for 
those of, the Catholic faith, tells 
of the little boy in long-ago Ire- 
land to whom the farmers used 
to bring their seed because, they 
said, if Fiachra planted it the 
grain would surely ripen. It tells 
too of how Fiachra, weary of the 


strife in Ireland, sought peace in jf 


France as a hermit, of how he 
wrought miracles in his wonder- 
ful gardens in Breuil, and how, 
centuries after his death, his 


name was given to the first 


French cabs and has clung ever 
since. 

The facts of the good saint’s 
life as the author has sifted them 
from legend are more picturesque 


in conception than in actual nar- ‘333% 
* vation, but the story is told with 
*  gimplicity and devotion, and Mr. ~* 
Beebe's drawings show the saint ~ 
“as an appealingly boyish young ts 
figure. < 


In Mexico 
POPO’S MIRACLE. By Charlie 
May Simon. I[Uustrated by 
Howard Simon. 223 pp. New 
York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $2. 
If Mrs. Simon has deserted, 
only temporarily it is to be hoped, 
the piney woods of the Ozarks 
for a more exotic setting, she is 
still writing of people who are 
fundamentally the same. Hér In- 
dians of the Mexican mountains 


_ are, like the people of Lost Cor- 


“- Edgar could bear, when even the 


Boy, for whose schooling the 
crew held a deep respect, failed 


* to settle them, Edgar went jun- 
~ keting off to settle disputed points 


straight facts from natura! his- 
tory should pass this by, but those 
who enjoy tall tales will find the 
situations both exciting and amus- 
ing, even though the humor is not 
of the most cbvious sort. In 
spite of a certain wordiness, 
the narrative is conceived in 
a typically English mood of 
understatement and matter-of- 
factness which adds to the incon- 
gruity and surprise. even though 
it never quite touches the heights 
of absurdity. It is an excellent 
vehicle for Irene Robinson's tal- 
ents as a portrayer of animals 


about Madagascar, the North 
Pole and the White House. It 
was a red-letter day for them all 
when they picked up Mr. Brit- 
tanica and Mr. Funken Wagnails, 
even though the Boy laughed 
rather heartieasly at their report 
of the visit. The Boy was the 
wisest of them all, and only he 
escaped the dénouement which 
was inevitable, considering Ed- 
gars curiosity and the specula- 
tions of the crew. 

This absurd, high-flown fooling 
has the consistency, the juggling 
of logic, of true fantasy. Never 


ner, instinct with the kindliness 
and the enjoyment of life of those 
who live close to the earth. 

They have, too, their own rigid 
code of honesty. When Popo, a 
mouse-colored donkey, ambied 
down the mountainside to the lit- 
tle Mexican village, he became, 
until such time as his owner 
could be identified, the property 
of young Rafael who found him 
—but not the pack on his back. 
Even though that was filled with 
paints tempting beyond words to 
the self-taught young artist, 
these could not be touched. How 
Popo lived happily as a member 


of the family and the community . 


until the night that Rafael 
dreamed that the time had come 
to take him back to his unknown 
master, how the two of them 
made their way over the moun- 
tains to the city where Rafael 


mon with material for some fine 
illustrations; those in color have 
caught the brilliance and action 
of the primitive village life. 


Chinese Folk Tales 


THE MAGIC SPEAR AND OTH- 
ER STORIES OF CHINA’S 
FAMOUS HEROBS. By Louise 


There is about this collection 
of Chinese folk tales a zestful 
quality, that which springs from 
a storyteller’s enjoyment of his 
own tale. How much of it stems 


Here is the story of Yoh Fei, one 
of the greatest of China’s heroes, 
who with his magic spear, held 
back the Tartars from the Sung 
kingdom until treachery sent him 
to his death. Here is the story 
of the Heavenly Jade of Ho, which 
passed by devicus routes emong 
the lords of the Seven States and 
finally became the Seal of Em- 
pire. The wit and strategy of the 
Chinese is illustrated in narra- 
tives of how Chuko Liang répelled 
an overpowering enemy by open- 
ing the gates of his city and of 
Yen-Yin, five-foot wit, who put 
the insulting Lord of Ch’u tc 
shame, while the famous Orienta) 
patience is embodied in the meth- 
ods whereby Ché Tsa became the 
greatest marksman in the land. 


Illustrations by ‘Yench’'i Tiao 
T’u are in the Chinese manner, 
and a pleasing note is added by 
Ching Chih Yee’s decorations in 
lacquer red. 


Kenneth Roberts’s ‘Northwest 
Passage” is now an international 
best-seller. In England it is the 
choice of both leading book clubs 
and has gone through four large 
printings in four weeks. In Aus- 


tralia the publishers report a~ 


second printing before publication 
and even greater advance sales 
than “Gone With the Wind.” 
Within the next six months it will 
be published in France, Italy, 
Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Fin- 
land, Poland and Norway. The 
motion-picture rights have been 


“-  aequired by M.-G.-M. The next 


self it is hard to tell, but one sus- 
pects the proportions are about 
equal, for as Mrs. Crane says, 
wit and cleverness are much es- 
teemed by the Chinese, and if her 
own style is neither particularly 
colorful nor individual, it has an 
ingratiating air of gossip, almost 
of intimate reminiscence. 

These are stories which Mrs. 
Crane heard again and again 
from Chinese children reared in 
the traditions of their people. 


novel by Kenneth Roberts will be 
published by Doubleday, Doran in 
1939. By special arrangement, a 
non-fiction book, ‘““Trending Into 
Maine,”. will be published in May 
by Little, Brown & Co. Thia is 
a book about Maine as Mr. Rob- 
erts knows it, with illustrations 
by N.C. Wyeth. The edition ts 
limited to 1,075 copies, 1,000 of 
which are for sale. A trade edi- 
tiom will be published later in the

she was waiting for Jack Shea 
to appear. 

Her first love affair, briefly 
lyrical, was followed by disillu- 
sion. Afterward, recovering her 
spirits, Sarah began to dream of 
happiness. Perhaps what she had 
felt for Jack was not love after 
all, but only a sort of adventur- 
ous excitement. The novels and 
magazine stories she read de- 
picted a kind of happiness out- 
side her experience. She de- 
acribed it to herself, in thinking 
about it, as a good home. Some- 
thing secure, and preferably far 
away from Texas. It was in this

ERE, in “Strumpet Wind,” 
is the background for mur- 


a matrimonial advertisement. 
There is, in everything that 
happens to Sarah after this point, 
a kind of inevitability. And yet 
it is all pathetically pointless, as 
if she were walking forward 
blindly and without volition to a 


der—one of those common- 
place, rather stupid murders 
which seem, when we read about 
them in the newspapers, to be a 
story we have encountered often fate it never cocure te her te

one of those familiar tragedies Batten, the young California 


and make real for us the story be- 
hind the headlines, usually has 
succeeded in illuminating some 
odd corner of human character. 
This is what Gertrude Bosworth 
Crum, with great simplicity and 
directness, has set out to do in 
her portrait of the inarticulate 
Sarah Batten. Her novel is writ- 
ten with a kind of studied naiveté. 
It has a matter-of-fact quality 


farmer of the advertisement, her 
* efforts to fit into the life of Jesse 
and his father on their isolated 
ranch in the California hills, her 
wordless passion for Pancho 
Esquer, who represents to her 
everything she has found Jesse is 
not, are all steps in the same un- 
comprehended progress. 
“Strumpet Wind” is an un- 
usually competent first novel well 
planned and executed without 
waste motion. If Sarah's story 
is not impressively tragic—and it 
is hard to feel any one so lack- 
ing in inner conflict as an au- 
thentic figure of tragedy—it is 
at least real and touching. One 
has no hesitation in saying that 
Mrs. Crum has written a good 
novel, and will some day write 
a better. M. W. 


A Young Radical 
REAP THE WHIRLWIND. By 
Edith Roberts. 306 Pages) In- 
dianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill 
Company. $2.50. 
ICE Mr. Andrews, a com- 
plete Babbitt, is on a Med- 
iterranean cruise. A pale, 
thin young man comes aboard 


which matches Sarah’s own tem- 
perament—which perhaps. ex- 
presses it as Sarah herself cer- 
tainly cannot do. 

Sarah, silent by nature, never 
had been encouraged to express 
anything. Until she was 16 she 
worked in her aunt’s grocery 
store, spending long hours behind 
the counter. Then because a cus- 
tomer, a well-dressed young man 
from Texas, suggested that she 
did not need to work like that, 
she ran away. She went straight 
to his town in Texas—it was the 
only place in the United States 
where she knew a single face— 
and found a job as waitress in 
a lunch room. Almost automat- 
ically, in refusing the company 
of men she met in the restaurant,

ship at Dubrovnik, the Yugoslav 
port. The young man keeps to 
himself and spends most of his 
time propped up in bed writing 
interminably. He seems to Mr. 
Andrews to be a nice American 
boy and he feels worried about 
him. Also, he feels there is some- 
thing strange and romantic about 
the young man. He wants a tale 
to tell to the home folks when he 
gets back and wants to find out 
what lies behind the mysterious- 
ness. 

He finds out. Young Neil Jor- 
dan had got himself involved in a 
Yugoslav revolutionary uprising 
against the dictatorship. He had 
been thrown into a concentration 
camp. His Dad had pulled 


enough wires to get him released 


and he is now on his way home. 
But at Gibraltar he leaves the 
ship; he is going to fight for the 
Loyalists in Spain. With Mr. An- 
drews, however, he leaves letters 
to his family and friends at home

It is the time of the depression 
and Neil Jordan is in Chicago 
University. .There he meets Petar 


Montich, a young Yugoslav stu- 
dent. He and Petar become great 
friends and his own undisciplined 
radicalism takes form under the 
guidance of the Slav Marxian. 
Petar almost becomes corrupted 
in America. He loves the free- 
dom, the higher standard of liv- 
ing, the approach to democracy. 


He falls in love with Neil's cousin, 


an intelligent girl of sound bour- 
geois family, and she with him. 
But the time comes when he 
makes his decision to go back to 
the homeland, where revolution- 
ary leaders are needed. Neil goes 
with him. The rest of the story 
tells of their struggle in the un- 
derground revolutionary move- 
ment in the Balkans. 


I am afraid this is not a very 


effective “challenge to a world in 
turmoil.” There is no point In 
hurling unkind words at it It

study in Turkey during the com- 
ing Summer. Dr. Ireland was a 
member of the first American 
University Expedition after the 
war to study and photograph 
Wadi Musa and Petra, and his 
work or that expedition resulted 
in his election as a fellow of the 
Royal Geographical Society of

On May 20 the Bobbs-Merrill 
Company will publish a new mys- 
tery story, “Thirteen Guests,” by 
Jefferson Farjeon, his first book 
to appear in this country for sev- 
eral years. Mr. Farjeon is a 
grandson of Joseph Jefferson, the 
actor, and a son of Benjamin 
Farjeon, who started writing 
povels at the suggestion of 
Charles Dickens and eventually 
produced sixty of them. Jeffer- 
son Farjeon’s brother is the au- 
thor of a current smash hit in 
London, and his sister, Eleanor 
Farjeon, is a well-known writer. 


Cc. Oumansky, Counselor, Em-

Gorky Institute of Literature, 
Moscow, to appeal to American 
readers for documents, letters or 

f 


other material relating to Gorky's 
visit to the United States in 1906. 
Any material sent to Mr. Ouman- 
sky will be gratefully received 
and forwarded to the institute, 
which is gathering biographical 
data on Maxim Gorky. 

Stackpole Sons have issued 
what is probably the smallest 
limited edition ever published — 
an edition of two copies of Pare 
Lorentz’s “The River,” bound in 
light blue full morocco and 
stamped in gold. Each book 
bears the following legend: “This 
edition is limited to two copies, 
one of which has been presented 
to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 
President of the United States, 
and the other to Pare Lorentz, 
producer and author of the mo- 
tion picture ‘The River.’” 

The Tuttle Publishing Com- 
pany, Rutland, Vt., informs us 
that the price of “A Genealogy 
of Williams Families,” by J. 
Oliver Williams, is $7.50, not $5 
as was stated in our announce- 
ment on March 27. Also, the 
book is the genealogy of Emman- 
uel Williams of Massachusetts as 
well as of William Williams of 


-Connecticut. 


Announcement is made of the 
opening of the Hungarian Refer- 


ence Library at 19 West Forty- | 


fourth Street, New York City. 
The collections in this library, 
consisting of books,. magazines 
and newspapers in both English 
and Hungarian, dealing with Hun- 
gary and its problems, are avail- 
able for consultation by the pub- 
lic free of charge on weekdays 
betweén the hours of 9 A. M. and 
5 P. M. The main part of the 
library has been gathered 
through thirty years by the late 
Charles Feleky, scholar, biblio- 
phile and collector. In 1937 the 
collection was acquired by the 
Hungarian National Museum in 
Budapest in order to establish 
in the United States a free refer- 
ence library which could provide 
expert information on all Hun- 
garian problems. 


Lewis Browne, author of “Oh,

University of the Centro de 
Estudios de Mexico in July. 
Among other lecturers invited 
for this seasion are Bertrand Rus- 
sell, Harold J. Laski, J. B. S. Hal- 
dane, G. D. H. Cole, Ernst Toller 
and Heywood Broun. 

Inez Sabastian Gerhard, 307 
East Forty-fourth Street, New 
York City, is writing a historical 
novel against the background of 
Utah in early days, and she would 
like to hear from any of our 
readers who have letters, diaries 
or old newspapers dealing with 
the activities of Hector McQuarrie 
or Robert Gardner, who founded 
the city of St. George, Utah, in 
1861. 


There are indications that eith- 
er the drinking classes have taken 
to literature or the literate class- 
ea have taken to drink. What 
else can one conclude from the 
naming of cocktails after books? 
Reuben's Restaurant in New 
York has a new cocktail called 
“Sixteen Hands,” after Homer 
Croy’s novel of the same title 
recently published by Harper & 
Brothers. No doubt the cocktail 
is supposed to have a kick like 
that of the mule which is the 
central figure in Mr. Croy'’s book.

Rousing Yarns of Life 


In the Old Navy 


ROOM TO SWING A CAT: Be- 
ing Some Tales of the Old 
Navy. By Lieutenant Frederick 
J. Bell, U. 8S. N. With Draw- 
ings by Pauline Glidden Bell. 
272 pp. Philadelphia: Long- 
mans, Green & Co. $3. 

By HANSON W. BALDWIN 


YARN spun by a sailor is 
always well worth the 
reading, and this one is no 
exception to the rule. For 

“Room to Swing a Cat” re- 
creates, with close fidelity to de- 
tail, some of the atmosphere, 
some of the life of our early 
navy, and to all who love the rare 
adventure of frigate fights, the 
salty stories of ancfent tars, the 
breath of the wind and the voice 
of the sea, this lively little volume 
will come as a welcome addition 
to our anthology of yesterday's 
glories. 

Lieutenant Bell has done & 
deal of work and has performed 
a labor of love in assembling and 
recording within the covers of a 
single book these anecdotes, clas- 
sic and obscure, and these details 
of yesterday for the information, 
entertainment and inspiration of 
today and tomorrow. In no other 
single book of modern times with 
which this reviewer is acquaint- 
ed, probably not even Theodore 
Roosevelt's history of the War 
of 1812, can be found, for in- 
stance, so many details of life 
within the wooden walls of our 
early navy, of the seagoing rou- 
tine of those days, of the environ- 
ment, equipment and customs. 
This is the most valuable part of 
“Room to Swing a Cat”; these 
three chapters, “The Wooden 
Walls,” “Afore the Mast and On 
the Quarter-Deck,” and “Life and 
Limb in a Wooden Ship” contain 
a vast amount of information 
that cannot but interest al] who 
love our blue-water past. Most of 
our famous frigate fights are, 
after all, rather well known, and 
Lieutenant Bell contributes little 
that is new in discussing John 
Paul Jones, or the Constitution- 
Guerriere, or the United States- 
Macedonian, and with a few of 
his details of these and other in- 
cidents other authors may quar- 
rel. But he does himself proud 
when he writes of 24-pounders 
and chain shot, of early naval 
uniforms and salt horse, of flog- 
gings and punishments, and fu- 
ture writers on our early naval 
history are going to owe him a 
debt of gratitude for his clear, 
concise collation and description 
of these facts, which are not new 
but have been too much neg- 
lected. 

The title of this book—-‘‘Room 
to Swing a Cat’’—must in itself 
proclaim to many a puzzled read- 
er the need to assemble and ex- 
plain such forgotten items in our 
nautical past. ‘Room to Swing a 
Cat” was once a familiar phrase 
to American ears, but those days 
are done. It is a phrase of: the 
days of wooden ships and iron 
men, when brawny boatswain's 
mates demanding of the lined-up 
crew “room to swing a cat,” 
lashed men with the cat o’ nine 
tails until they groaned into un- 
conseiousness. The floggings were 
always administered on the spar 
or upper decks, since the low 
overhead below decks gave the 
boatswain no room to swing his 
bloody cat, with its nine lead-pel- 
leted, or knotted, tails. 

Lieutenant Bell minces no words 
when he tells of these, to us, 
berberic customs, accepted a cen- 
tury ago, however, as a matter of 
course. His chapter on the flog- 


gings and punishments of old, 
from which the book takes its 
title, reveals one particularly 
crass incident of those days, 
gleaned from an oid court-mar- 
tial record, when one Thomas 
Graves, able seaman of the fri- 
gate Constitution, got 100 lashes 
“with the cats on his bare back” 
and was flogged through the 
fleet. This particular form of 
flogging in which the offender 
was triced to a grating in a small 
boat and rowed about the fleet to 
be lashed at each ship often 
meant death to the victim. 

It was not uncommon in the 
British Navy of that day, but its 
‘application to American tars was 
rare, and Lieutenant Bell’s ac- 
count of the invocation of this 
punishment, as well as his de- 
scriptions of the unpalatable salt 
horse, the weevil-ridden ship's 
biscuit, the cheese with its ‘“va- 
riety of long, yellow worms,” in- 
deed reveals what “iron men” we 
had to man our wooden ships. 

An old veteran's deacription of 
the life: “It is a right down life 
of hard wear and tear, and the 
man who is not, in a good degree, 
fitted to become a common sailor 
will never make an officer,” 
would seem in the light of these 
things to be a masterpiece of un- 
derstatement. 

In addition to his three valuable 
chapters on the life within these 
wooden walls of old, Lieutenant 
Bell gives us a “Portrait of a 
Sailor,” a sketch of John Paul 
Jones, and describes in three 
chapters our wars with the Bar- 
bary corsairs. There is an in- 
teresting section on “Duels and 
Sundry Bloody Encounters” which 
shows what swaggering, lovable, 
hard-fighting, proud cock-of-the- 
walk our younger naval officers 
of those days were. Lieutenant 
Bell’s account of the defense of 
the American privateer General 
Armstrong, Captain S. C. Reid 
commanding, in the harbor of 
Fayal, Azores, against an over: 
whelmingly superior British fleet 
—‘“ninety men against two thou- 
sand, and the ninety won the 
fight”—retells what should be as 
much of a classic to Americans 
as the fight of Sir Richard 
Grenville of the Revenge is to 
Englishmen. There is an amusing 
chapter on superstitions and an- 
other on “Yarniets,” and this 
interesting,: well-compiled book, 
which every lover of old blue- 
water days will want to add to his 
library shelf as a companion piece 
to Lovette’s “Naval Customs, 
Traditions and Usage,” ends with 
a collection of old songs. The 
chapter headings and drawings 
by Mrs. Bell add materially to the 
book’s attractiveness. 

In her autobiography, “The 
World at My Shoulder,” which 
the Macmillan Company will 
publish this month, Eunice Tiet- 
jens says: ‘All the characters in 
this book are real—none are fic- 
titious. All persons are referred 
to and identified by their proper 
names and every word said about 
them is intentional.” There we 
have an interesting variant from 
the usual disclaimer of intention- 
al portraiture. Another Macmil- 
lan author, Jonathan Daniels, 
whose “A Southerner Discovers 
he South” will appear in June. 
offers another departure from 
the standard practice. He says: 
“Ali of the characters in this 
book are fictitious, though most 
of them will be surprised to dis- 
cover it.”

“SLEEP 
in PEACE 


by Phyllis Bentley 


— is another splendid novel of that 
region she knows so intimately. Miss 
Bentley shows more sterling worth in 
everything she writes than many of 
her more flamboyant contemporaries. 


“Thoughtful, honest, convincing of 
provocative, now one, now the other, 
Sleep in Peace is a novel that stirs the 

- reader to probe life for himself.” 


—PERCY HUTCHISON, 
New York Times

“It is a book to be studied, not idly read. 
I know of no other which gives as up-to-

A WOMAN MAKES HER MARK IN 


Louise Boyd, Who Has Often Known 


men discover her this time 
first occasion on which 


‘ee61 ‘1 Aepy ‘aurze2epw sausy ys0 


Arctic Adventure, Goes North Again 


geographers, and men of science visit her 
home at San Rafael, Calif. 

At intervals since 1926 she has been 
bucking polar storms in the stout but 
small Norwegian sealers which she 
charters, or plowing slowly and crunch- 
ingly through the pack ice around north- 
ern islands or off the east coast of 
Greenland, She surveyed much of that 
coast which had never been properly 
charted before, and did so well that the 
Danish Government named it after her. 
And one does not do such things without 
having adventures; so far she has kept 
these to herself. 

“I haven't wanted to talk about my- 
self, for I did not know when I started 
out that I could do the job,” she said re- 
cently. “I had to learn first whether I 
was suited for leadership, particularly 
with a group of men; and, second, 
whether I could contribute anything of 
value. I think I have produced something 
worth while, of which I can be proud, and 
as for the men, most of them go back 
with me each voyage. We get along fine.” 


Boy successful Miss Boyd has been is 
shown by the fact that two foreign gov- 
ernments have decorated her, and the 
American Geographical Society, a con- 
servative organization, has published two 
of her books. She is better known in 
Norway and Denmark and in the Arctic 
seas than in her own country. 

There is little about Miss Boyd when 
in New York to suggest a woman who 


prefers wearing rough 
clothes and living for long 
periods on one of the 
stormiest and most dan- 
gerous oceans in the world. 
She dresses as a woman 
of means, and enjoys a tea 
gown. She brings her maid 
and her car and chauf- 
feur with her when she 
comes to New York. Her 
home in San Rafael is al- 
most mid-Victorian in 
its conventionality, except 
when she entertains the 
entire Police and Fire De- 
partments at Christmas 
time. She is a member 
of the executive commit- 
tee and the board of gov- 
ernors of the San Fran- 
cisco Symphony Orches- 
tra, and she belongs, to 
half a dozen horticultural 
societies. 

' “IT like the pleasant 
things most women enjoy, 
even if I do wear breeches 
and boots on an expedi- 
tion, even sleep in them at 
times. I have no use for 
masculine women. At sea I don’t bother 
with my hands, except to keep them from 
being frozen, but I powder my nose before 
going on deck, no matter how rough the 
sea is. There is no reason why a woman 
can’t rough it and still remain feminine.” 


Miss BOYD is not quite sure why 
she became an explorer. She had never 
geen snow until she was in her teens, but 
she was brought up to ride and shoot and 
enjoy outdoor life in the California hills. 
Her early years were largely taken up 
with the care of her father’s home, and 
she did not have the time to roam very 
far until she was over 30. But she 
dreamed of making some sort of career, 


because she could not bear being idle. The - 


Arctic fascinated her, and she read every 
book she could find which told of ex- 
ploration and adventure in the north. 
When she was free to do as she wished 
she headed north like an eider duck. 
That was in 1926, the year that Amund- 
gen and Elisworth flew from Spitsbergen 
to Alaska in the Norge. One of the ves- 
sela which went to Spitsbergen with sup- 
plies for the airship was a little sealer 


m called the Hobby, one of the rollingest

boats ever launched. When the airship 
left, the Hobby went back to Tromsi, 
Norway, to be refitted for a voyage to 
“Some American 
woman wants to see ice,” said the captain 
to the writer, who went back to Norway 
on the ship and was sick every foot of 
the way. a

A MAN'S DOMAIN 


Lowise A. Boyd—"There is no reason why a 


woman can't rough it and remain feminine.” 


The American woman was Miss Boyd 
A few years before, as a passenger on a 
tourist ship, she had glimpsed the edge 
of the ice pack and was determined that 
one day she would be on the inside looking 
out. She had difficulty in getting there, 
because the ice pilot to whom she was re- 
ferred did not want to take a woman 
north. She begged, pleaded and cajoled, 
and told of her outdoor life at home, and 
finally he consented to get her a ship. But 
he did it reluctantly. 


As they neared the pack Miss Boyd 
spent twenty-four hours on deck. “They 
could smell ice, and would stick their 
noses up and sniff it,” she said in relating 
the experience. “And they expected me to. 
How could I know what ice smelled like? 
But I wanted to be there at the start. 
ready when the gates to the Arctic 
opened and let me enter. What was the 
loss of a night's sleep” Nothing!” 


Ee hours the edge of the pack was 
hidden by fog. From behind the curtain 
came the growl of cakes pounding to- 
gether, the swish and roar of waves 
breaking in surf; then suddenly the ship 
was into it, grinding its way through the 
floes to the peace of the interior. There 
the ship ran through open leads, like lakes 
or tiny rivers, only to hit solid ice and ram 
through it again. When the fog lifted and 
the sun shone on the white floes Miss 
Boyd was where she had wanted to be 

inside the pack; and to one entering it for 


the first time it is a fascinating experi- 
ence. 


“I had a feeling of regret that isola- 
tion, combined with some danger, made 
this beauty inaccessible and known to so 
few,” she said “I understood for the 
first time what an old seaman meant 
when he told me that once you had been 
to the Arctic and in the ice you never 
could forget it and always wanted to go 
back.” 

She went to Franz Josef Land and shot 
a@ few polar bears--for what would a first 
trip north be without a bearskin for a 
trophy’ Polar bears are Miss Boyd's 
favorite animals. She has watched them 
for hours, has photographed them in 
every conceivable position and knows all 
their habits. While out with a camera one 
day, chasing & polar bear, she was lost 
in a fog in a smal! boat, with a gale 
rising. There were a few hours of real 
danger, for the pack was breaking under 
the force of the gaie and the cakes were 
beginning to toss perilously near. When 
the ship was finally sighted the boat crew 
discovered that they had passed the Hobby 
and were rowing away from her. “And 
it was cold in that (Continued on Pave 20

THE BATTLE

izations of public men of his time. 

Fancy played in and out with 
his sense of humor. He had a 
chuckle for appreciation, one kind 
of snort for disapproval and 
another kind for a good joke, 
which might be on himself. When 
he was in a certain mood it was 
hard to tell whether he was 
whimsically ironic, in earnest or 
half in earnest. He was in this 
mood when, mentioned for the 
Presidency, he said, in effect, that 
considering some of the men who 
had been President he might not 
do so badly. But he was deadly 
in earnest in one favorite remark: 
The ambitious, pushing Kaiser 
Wilhelm would yet make trouble 
in the world. 

On the instant when any pro- 
fessional question came up he 
was again the decisive command- 
er. Nothing on board his ships 
seemed to escape him. He had 
his little squadron as much under 
his eye as a modern flotilla com- 
mander has his destroyers, in 
contrast with the present com- 
mander of our fleet who has his 
150 ships spread over a wide 
area. And whereas he fought his 


battle at a two-and-a-half-mile | 


range, a modern battleship action 
will begin at twenty miles. 

“It was the thing to do,” as he 
said about Manila Bay “—-what 
Farragut would have done.” 

Ask him when he would return 
home and the answer always was, 
“When I get my orders.” Wash- 
ington took it for granted the 
great Dewey would come when 
he was ready. If Washington had 
not had private word he was

ready and bidden him choose his 
time, it might have been two 
years instead of a year after the 
battle before he weighed anchor. 


I HAD many talks with him on 
his leisurely homeward cruise by 
way of Suez and the Mediter- 
ranean ports while the people 
were preparing for his colossal 
reception at home in September, 
1899. In the greatest land parade 
of our history he would ride in 
triumph under the stucco Dewey 
Arch, in Madison Square, which 
later would be reproduced in en- 
during stone. “Welcome Dewey” 
would blaze in electric lights be- 
tween the piers of the Brooklyn 
Bridge. May 1 was to be a per- 
manegt national holiday as 
Dewey Day. 

Our other Spanish War heroes 
had been deflated, but Dewey's 
stature .had continued to grow. 
Word of his trials with von Die- 
drichs had leaked out to make the 
victor of battle also sage, diplo- 
mat and statesman beyond com- 
pare. Newspaper men flocked on 
board the Olympia when she 
dropped anchor in New York Har- 
bor. Without indicating any off- 
the-record restriction, he talked 
in random freedom. 

I saw him flush with chagrin 
as he read his chatter in quota- 
tion marks, and then on the 
bridge of the Olympia, leading 
the naval parade up the North 
River before the crowded piers 
and housetops, in their rapturous 
cheering, I heard his “All this for 
me!""--as it was all for him as 
he stood before the sea of faces 


ity and a season ticket here for 
somebody. Remembering Chicago, 
how about “The Orbit of Venus” ?

These are some of the broad 
hints the enthusiasts at Flushing 
Meadows Park throw out to the 
inquiring world these days, with 


the opening of the fair still a year- 


away. If only half of them come 
true, it will still be a great fair. 


AN EMPIRE 


around the East Front of the 
Capitol to receive the sword of 
honor voted him by Congress. 

And there was the lady. The 
commodore, who was a widower, 
was returning to her as four-star 
admiral. The silent hero had be- 
come a voluble old sailor ashore, 
in love and worse. Public sub- 
scription had presented him a 
house. He gave this to his bride, 
and then they did not live in it, 
since she had a larger house of 
her own she liked better. He 
settled down to domesticity, faith- 
ful to his duties as chairman of 
the General Board of the navy. 

Then he was caught by pub- 
lication of his favorite allusion 
to the ambitious Kaiser which 
brought outraged official protest 
from Berlin. When President 
Theodore Roosevelt asked him to 
repudiate the statement, he said, 
‘I can't deny what I said, though 
I had no idea it would be pub- 
lished.” T. R. replied: “In that 
case I must give you a formal 
reprimand.” To receive this 
Dewey appeared at the White 
House in full dress’ uniform. 
“Consider yourself reprimanded,” 
said T. R., patting him on the 
wrist as the prologue to a pleas- 
ant chat. 

Dewey lived to see Japan's vic- 
tory over Russia in 1904-05; see 
his prophecy fulfilled in the 
trouble the Kaiser made for the 
world in 1914, and died two 
months before our entry into the 
World War. In moments of recol- 
lection, he would say: “The vic- 
tory remains. Could anybody 
have done a better job than we 
did in Manila Bay?”

attended in the middle of crowds 
on every possible occasion and 
for talking familiarly with com- 
mon laborers whenever he sees 
men at work. Another problem 
for the police is his practice of 
riding on a motor cycle in the 


which traffic is unusually very 
heavy, must be watched. 

The Villa Torionia, where Mus- 
solini lives with his family, is 
guarded by uniformed police, and 
Royal Carabineers may be seen 
walking in pairs day and night 
around the high wall that eur- 
rounds the park of the villa. It 
is a comparatively simple mat- 
ter to prevent unauthorized per- 
sons from gaining access to the 
villa, since it is situated in a 
quiet residential district, where 
any unusual activity on the part 
of strangers would immediately 
attract attention. To make as- 
surance doubly sure, a number of 
plainclothes men are stationed in- 
side the grounds and keep close 
watch, especially at night. 


|e armed detachment of 
Moschettieri di Mussolini (Mus- 
solini's Musketeers, a small 
personal bodyguard of picked 
men supplied by the Fascist 
Militia) do sentry duty at the 
main door of the Palazzo Venezia, 
where Mussolini has his offices, 
but they are there mainly for 


manner every day, but the whole 
thing is done with so little com- 
motion that most Romans are 
unaware of the many pairs of 
eyes watching every meve they 


in his bedroom from the moment 
he leaves it in the morning to 
the moment he returns to it in 
the evening. 

The point to be emphasized is 
the complete lack of fuss and 
show in ail the measures taken to 


insure Mussolini's safety. When | 


other dictators appear in the 


uniformed and armed ; : 


- men are everywhere is evidence, 


and keep a sharp lookout for sus- 
picious characters. At certain 
hours of the day a very keen ob- 


ness that for a few minutes had 
been sensed rather than felt re- 
laxes, and everything returns to 
normal again. 

The unceasing battle of wits 
between the police and any per- 
sons who may be animated by 
murderous intentions toward 
Mussolini has caused the precau- 
tions to extend to other fields. 
The city drains, for instance, are 
inspected daily for fear that ex- 
plosives may be deposited in them 
and toyched off when he passes 
in the street above; the openings 
under the curbs to allow rain- 
water to escape from the streets 
into the drains have all been 
closed with gratings so that no 
bombs may be placed in them; 
the electric-light standards in the 
streets have been searched pe- 
riodically ever since one was 
used in Milan ten years or so ago 


to hide an infernal machine that 


endangered the life of the King. 
The inmates of all houses along 
the routes most frequently trav- 
eled by Mussolini are watched 
with particular care and are fre- 
quently warned that they will be 
held responsible for the actions of 
strangers using their windows; 
the janitors are instructed to re- 


port any suspicious circumstance. 
e 


, = political police, known as 
the O. V. R. A., are also very ac- 
tive and constantly on the look- 
out for plots against Mussolini's 
life. All travelers, whether Ital- 


ou ian or foreign, are carefully scru- 


very efficiently and 
very unobtrusively. Any one lin- 
gering on the sidewalks around 
the Palazzo Venezia is accosted 
quietly by one or more men, 
whom he had probably taken, if 


he had noticed them at all, for ° 


tinized at the frontiers, where 
the police have long lists of sus- 
pects who must be arrested at 


sight. The authorities are en- | 


abled to keep track easily of the 
movements of all travelers by 
means of the regulations requir- 


e ing them to register at police 


headquarters within twenty-four 
hours of their arrival in any 
town; motorists can with diffi- 


mony, particularly if the route 
he is to follow is known before- 


and their very attitudes bespeak 
watchfulness and tension; Mus- 
solini drives apparently un- 


Everywhere people praise this.

‘UNIFYING A VARIETY OF ead bis ad 


A Problem Is Solved 
At a Picture Gallery 


By WALTER RENDELL STOREY 

T is not easy for even a pro- 
[reeves interior decorator to 

create a fine éffect in a room 

when a client insists on re- 
taining there all his collector's 


pieces, whether they happen to fit 


Decorated by George C. Frelinghuysen Jr. 


An antique quilt cover used on a sofa. 


tive unity not always obtained 


in rooms with meta! furniture. 


A colorful living room, going 
back to the English Regency 
style of the early nineteenth cen- 
tury for its inspiration, is the 
work of Dorothy Paly and Helen 
Reiners. It successfully catches 
the color nuances of the pictures 


. by Renoir, Picasso and other 


vivid painters on the walls. 
While the spirit is quite different 
from that of the Frelinghuysen 
interior, it, too, has the pleasing 
aspect of a room that has slowly 
developed over a period of years. 

Completely Victorian, especial- 
ly in its femininity, is the soft 
and lacy effect of a room ar- 
ranged by the gallery for paint- 
ings of Dietz Edzard, a modern 
French artist. Perhaps this room 
is too perfect a reproduction of 
the period it derives’ from to 


. make much of an appeal to our 


paniment heb Geb wae evlhdeen. 
These range from a rare maple 


Anne arm chair with a seat up- 
holstered in old cut velvet; and 


| from Staffordshire china to 


scrimshaw work. A Chippendale 


im | sofa, which the decorator has 


covered with an eighteenth-cen-

! eae in the exhibi- 


im | tion, an original garden room has 
im| furniture of wrought and cast 
ma) iron. These pieces, reminiscent of 


25¢ 


the eighteenth century, have been 
made more comfortable by the 
designer, Richard L. Sandfort, 
who has supplied them with 
cushions. Painted metal and fab- 
rics have been carefully schemed 
so that their colors harmonize 
with the light green wallpaper of 
trellis design, giving a decora- 


leas romantic age. Considered 
individually, some of the furni- 
ture is quite charming, notably, 
the round black lacquer table, 
flower-decorated, and the sewing 
table in lacquer, mother-of-pearl 
and gilding. 


| EN terrace furniture has 
been so developed this season 
that it can be used either out- 
doors or in the dining room in- 
doors. Especially noticeable is 
the diversity of metals: wrought 
iron, aluminum, chromium-fin- 
ished steel, and bronze, either 
shiny or in a dull brown finish. 
Very smart are the pewter motifs 
get in wrought iron chair backs. 
Although period styles are fol- 
lowed, the distinctive character 
prescribed for Summer is still re- 
tained so that it presents a satis- 
fying change from the mahogany, 
walnut and maple pieces of Win- 
ter interiors. Rattan, bamboo and 
wicker are of course still popular. 
Greater harmony than hitherto 
has been managed between the

ee slip covers were merely 
Summer dust protectors, to be 
apologized for and removed as 
soon as cool weather came. Now 
they serve several purposes in 
addition: they provide a complete 
change of effect when wanted or 
take the place of permanent up- 
holstery on furniture bought “in 
the muslin”—that is, without the 
usual upholstery. 

Pre-shrunk fabrics, zippers, 
snap fasteners and expert tailor- 
ing make the slip cover of today 
as well fitting as regular up- 
holstery. Even the traditional 
flounce at the bottom may be 
eliminated, so that the legs of 
chairs and sofas can show. Al- 
though fashion decrees a certain 
light gayety in color and design 
for slip-cover fabrics, almost 
any light weight textile, from 
suede cloth to chintz, is quite in 
order.

exhibit at the World's Fair. Within the building Mr. Ford's 
idea—the growing interdependence of farm and factory. -will 
find graphic expression in displays which will include sugar 
cane, soy beans and cotton among the featured subjects. Wal-

his 12 looks the part it plays so well — 


Aor: aRANCE, alone, announces the Lincoln-Zephyr the only car of 
its kind at any price. This “twelve” looks the part it plays so well. 
It is modern in structure. [tis modern in performance. And it sells 
at a medium price. 

When a new owner first takes the wheel, he finds there is some- 
thing quite different about the easy, quiet behavior of the twelve- 
evlinder engine. It brings him new confidence in driving. It makes 
driving fun again. It has power in reserve, and smoothness to which 
he is unaccustomed, whether moving through traffic, or eating up 
miles on the open road. 

Experienced Lincoln-Zephyr owners find that a day's drive 
seems shorter than before (though usually it is longer), and that

the longest trips leave passengers relaxed and refreshed. Contrib- 
uting to their comfort is the fact that they ride “amidships” on chair- 
like seats, cushioned between soft transverse springs 136 inches apart. 

In every sense this car is unique. It is something new for twelve 
evlinders to give from fourteen to eighteen miles to the gallon. Yet 
these thrifty evlinders do! In this car, closed types have no “chassis.” 
Instead, body and frame are welded inte a rigid unit of steel trusses 
and panels. 

The Lincoln-Zephyr is a car full of forward-looking ideas that 
contribute to comfort, safety, ease of riding and driving. It increases 
the pleasures of motoring! And it is still years ahead! Lincoln Motor

A LITTLE REALIZED FACT ABOUT THE ALUMINUM BUSINESS 


From our start, fifty years ago, we have

eo serve his purpose better than any 
other material. He would buy only when he could see 
an immediate cash saving, or obvious value in months 
or years of service. We had to make aluminum cheap. 

Then we discovered that we were actually creating 
another kind of competition. One of aluminum’s 


virtues is that it resists corrosion. There is little losscf the

In recent years, more than one half of the ingot alumi-

“NOTE ON 
POETIC 
DRAMA 


By BROOKS ATKINSON 


OTHING much has hap 

pened in the field of poetic 

drama this season Al 

though it is !tmportant to 
the serious theatre, it is not pros 
pering just now. Maxwell Ander. 
gon wrote this vear's ‘‘The Star- 
Wagon” in prose Ashley Dukes's 
importation of the original T. 8 
Eliot s ‘‘Murder in the Cathedral” 
failed, partly because the staging 
did not stimulate it in terms of the 
theatre Stanley Young's ‘‘Robin 
Landing’’ was a literary tour de 
force. Although W. H. Auden and 
Christopher Isherwood's The As 
cent of F.6"" has been available for 
more than a year, no one has pro- 
duced it yet on Broadway, and prob- 
ably no one w 

. « « 

A good deal of the preliminary 
work for a poetic theatre has been 
done in the past three years: Max- 
well Anderson's ‘‘Winterset,’’ which 
is still a play of transcendent merit 
in the reading, and the Federal 
Theatre's versatile production of 
“Murder in the Cathedral’ very 
thoroughly spaded up the field. But 
before a good crop can be grown 
with confidence and expectation the 
poets must make up their minds 
about some of the elementary prir 
ciples of poetic drama The great 
public is not the least bit interested 
{n verse drama: it is not that aca- 
demic in its taste for art. But a 
vigorous dramatic poet with an in- 
stinct for the theatre can over- 
whelm the public if he wants to; 
and since a play cannot exist with- 
out an audience, he may as well 
make up his mind to it. The real-j 
istic drama has developed as far as 
it is ever going to, but there is no 
reason why the poetic drama 
should abandon the clarity, for 
and coherence that the realist 
drama has gained 

* * * 

ERY few poets know the t 
V atre Mr.. Anderson does 

does Sean O'Casey, altt 
he has written only one drama 
poetic form. But Mr. Eliot barely | 
uses the theatre in ‘‘Murder in the | 
Cathedral."" Although ‘“‘The Ascent 
of F.6"" by Mr. Auden and Mr 
Isherwood has been liberally praised 
and successfully produced in Lor 
don it has almost no value in the 
theatre. It is virtually a lexicon of 
the things a poet cannot do in the 
theatre if he wants to interest a 


‘ 


large audience, The realistic drama 
has abundantly proved the virtue of 
form in the telling of a story and 
in the development of charact 
what the realistic 
complished purely in 
nique is an improvement 
speare 
* = . 
But Mr. Auden and Mr. Isherwood 


have presided over the materia! of 


their play as though they were idly 
strumming a plano in the backroom 
of a grog-shop. They have broken 
their story into smal! bits which 
they scatter whimsically around the 
theatre; they shift moods arbi 
trarily, caricaturing their charac- 
ters when it, personally amuses 
them, afid seem to be completely 
lacking in the vitality that teache 
& writer how to make something 
decisive and whole out of a theme 
If writers are not clear in their 


minds about what they are d 


faa 


the audience cannot be inere is 
no strong line of development in 
their drama. It is not so muct 
vous playwrighting as neu: 
hibitionism. It is the drama 

written for the intelligent 
the intelligentsia, which 
only a small and arid part of 
earth's surface. It is self- 
ly trashy; the humor is wry 
Mirthless.

S Mr. Dukes points out 
current issue of Theatre Art 
Monthly, Mr. Auden ar 

Isherwood have succeeded in 
ing choruses that comment « 
theme with considerable f 
eloquence. But unless the 
drama is to be for the 
&Musement of clever inte 
needs solid architecture in 
the theatre. Mr. Auden 
Isherwood's capering fr 
Whim is not creative but « 
and the blunt fact is that it

R. ELIOT is an eminent poet 

—probably a great one. The 

verse in ‘‘Murder in the Ca- 
thedral” is the work of a master 
hand; some of it makes the scalp 
tingle when it is spoken in the 
theatre. Mr. Eliot is also a scholar 
with a philosophy that gives his 
work direction in a befuddled world, 
and ‘‘Murder in the Cathedral’’ is 
an organic work of art. For Mr. 
Eliot wears the garland and the 
singing robes with a style of a man 
who becomes them. But in this 
play he does not disclose much 
theatrical versatility; he does not 
use the theatre with anything like 
the command of the medium of a 
competent stage workman. ‘‘Mur- 
der in the Cathedral” is physically 
monotonous; it does not make an 
imaginative use of scene. Nor is 
the verse the best theatrical speech; 
it is sustained mostly on one note 
of abstraction; it is compact and 
unyielding—a study rather than a 
spontaneous expression, and it ts 
lacking in the power to differentiate 
characters. Good theatrical speech 
cannot be that reserved, as we 
know from listening to the boom- 
ing virtuosity of the Elizabethans 
who wrote, not for readers, but for 
listeners—for listeners, too, who 
probably had keener ears than we 


have now.

If Mr. Eliot had written his medi- 
tation on Thomas a Becket for the 
theatre instead of for a special oc- 
casion at Canterbury Cathedral, 
perhaps he would have given it 
greater human latitude, recognizing 
the varying tempers of his char-

FTER having spent twenty 
years in the theatre Mr. An- 
derson is the soundest crafts- 

man of the lot and ‘‘Winterset’’ is 
still the best of the modern poetic 
dramas An exalted theme torn 
out of the web of modern life, an 
exciting narrative, bold characteri- 
zations and fiery speech—these are 
elements of the practical theatre 
and ‘‘Winterset’’ represents them 
at their best. Some people have 
never been satisfied that Mr. An- 


derson is writing poetry because it | 


is loose in construction. It is true 
that he has overwritten his last 
three poetic plays, and he is often 
guilty of interpolating tumid pas- 
sages not essential to his play. But 
looseness is a virtue in the theatre 
where audiences are not composed 
exclusively of academicians. Al- 
though Mr. Anderson's line is not 
like Mr. Eliot's, it is be- 
is ineandescently 
passionate and vital and gives his 
theme considerable stature. If most 
of it were set as prose on the print- 
ed page it might look less typo 
graphically pretentious, but it would 
still be a dance of fiery particles 
across the footlights. Mr. Ander- 
son is the only author of poetic 
dramas who knows the theatre. If 
the public is to be invited, a knowl- 
edge of the theatre and a willing- 
ness to use it are the first essen- 
tials. The poetic drama must have 
a wholesome respect for what the 
realistic drama has already accom- 
plished.

S firmly as it can without 


specifying penalties, 
in the contract between the 
of New York Thea- 
and the Theatrical Managers, 
Agents and Treasurers Union for- 
| bids “‘ice’’—!. e., the sum paid by a 
|broker to a box office in excess of 
|} the printed price of a ticket. But 
lan indication that this clause may 
not be permanent is seen in the 
fact that the ways and means com- 
mittee of the treasurers’ group of 
the T. M. A. T. 1s considering a 
plan proposed by the Golden office. 

The Golden idea, as applied to 
“Susan and God"’ until ‘‘ice’’ was 
forbidden, is in effect a scheme to 
minimize prices 
charged by some brokers, For in- 
stance, a broker selling a $3.30 
ticket for $8.80 had to refund $2 to 
the box he sold it for 
$6.60, he returned $1, etc. These 
refunds-—or ‘‘ice'’—were formally 
added to the box-office statement 
of the show. 

The result, the Golden office con- 
tends, was to keep prices at a nor- 
mal level and at the same time to 
protect the public. The allotment 
of tickets to the brokers was not 
protected until two weeks in ad- 
vance of the date of the perform- 
ance, giving the public a chance at 
the choice locations if it applied 
early enough. 

Aside from ‘‘ice,"’ another factor

On that evening, ordinarily one

the season, an ex-critic telephoned | 


the box-office of a theatre and 
asked for two tickets. The box- 
office man candidly replied that a 
‘“‘buy’’ was in force, that more sat- 
isfactory locations could be ob- 
tained from a broker. The ex-critic 
took it in good spirit and paid 
the premium. Just before the cur- 
tain went up he decided to count 
the house and confirm the extraor- 
dinary ‘‘demand”’ for tickets on 
Good Friday. There were exactly 
sixty-four persons in the orchestra. 

“If I did not the theatre,”’ 
the ex-critic remarked, ‘I doubt if 
I'd ever go again.”’

Perhaps it has all been cleared up 
by now, but at midweek the Mer- 
cury Theatre was slightly embar- 
rassed about the royalty rate it was 
to pay on ‘‘Heartbreak House.”’ 
When Mr. Shaw cabled his consent 
to the revival he asked only a ‘‘rea- 
sonable’ sum—didn't say just what 
he meant by that. Usually his fee 
is a flat 15 per cent of the gross. 
Usually he isn’t so indefinite about 
it, either. 


Definitely canceled is The Play- 
ers’ fifteenth annual revival, for 
the reason indicated in these pages 
on April 18—not enough ‘‘names”’ 
were available to act the program 
of scenes from plays in which Ed-

thought of reviving ‘‘What Price

tain Flagg and James Cagney as 
Sergeant Quirt. Mr. Cagney would 
probably have been available. Mr. 
O'Brien was not. But it is still a 
good idea-—so good that The Play- 
ers are retaining it as a possibility 
for next year. 

Neither yes nor no is George Ab- 
bott’s answer to reports that he will 
polish the book of ‘‘You Never 
Know,"’ which he went to Pitts- 
burgh to see a week ago yesterday 
And what, Mr. Abbott was asked, 
about this rumor that his ‘‘What a 
Life’ boys and girls would make 
an extracurricular production of 
‘The Merchant of Venice’’? Still 
laconic, Mr. Abbott replied that 
they might read it this Summer, 
but just to pass the time of day and 
not with any idea of doing it pub- 
licly. (Which seems too bad, be- 
cause there was a happy whisper 
abroad that Sam Levene would 
come in and play Shylock.) In- 
deed, about all that Mr. Abbott was 
saving on the positive side was that 
‘Room Service’’ would lower its 
$3.30 top to $2.20 tomorrow eve- 
ning; all matinees hereafter, $1.65 


and down. 


Various people have suggested to 
la Roche that she write 
another play about the ‘‘White- 
oaks"’ people, and she said the 
other day that she wouldn't be sur- 
prised if she did so. One good rea- 
son would be the ‘‘Whiteoaks’’ box- 
score to date: the London production 
that opened April 14, 1936, and ran 
until a week ago last night, the 
New York production that is now 
in prosperous residence at the Hud- 
son. In the meantime, she has 
untitled, 
probably to be done first in London, 
then here. *“‘Whiteoaks,” by 
the way, is referred to as Miss de la 
Roche's play, and for the most 
part it is, although one other per- 
son is getting royalties on it—Nancy 
Price, who created the role Miss 
Barrymore plays here. 


Since it seems that Gladys George

Harmon's own interest 
Brock Pemberton, 
meanwhile, waits for her to make 
up her mind about acting in “‘The 
Nutmeg Tree.’ . You may now 
forget, if you had remembered it at 
all, that talk about Gertrude Law- 
rence doing a Spring revival for 
special matinees. 


Having waited this long to know 
if there it ever going to be a play 
called ‘‘Corner Pocket,’’ by Robert 
Rossen, you may as well wait a lit-

the manager. Most of the Boston 
Theatre successes were brought to 
the Academy. There was no other 
theatre in town with a stage large 
enough to mount them. I think the 
Academy and the Boston Theatre 
were practically the same 
dimensions The Theatre

Union Square was full of business 
in those days. Actors met man- 
agers on street corners and setiled 
business for the season to come 
with no contract but a shake of the 
hand. Of course, there were times 
when those managers didn't pay 
salaries, but the unreliable ones 
were pretty well known and the 
actors steered clear of them. There 
were three agents whom I went to 
to the exclusion of all others—Mrs. 
Fernandez, J. J. Spies and Simmons 
& Brown. Now every actor has his 
own agent.

|ia the theme. Let us observe how 
| Capek develops it. 
* * @ 

Like so many pacifist writer, in- 
cluding Mr. Sherwood, Capek has 
an obsession on the subject of ar- 
mament manufacturers. He treats 
jane as a cause and not, as seems 
more reasonable, as an effect. When 
|Baron Krug gets the plague, Dr. 
| Galen refuses to cure him unless he 
abandons the manufacture of armas. 


Krug, in terror of his life, pleads) of 


with the dictator for a policy of dis- 
armament, is overruled and shoots 
himself. The dictator then plunges 


the world into war and is himself | 


stricken by plague. 


Only Galen can cure him, and the 
dictator, in an agony of fear, con: 


| sents to Galen’s terms, persuading | 
himself—and dictators who con-)| 


sider that they are inspired can 
| persuade themselves of anything— 
| that the Almighty has now -con- 
| ventontiy commanded him to re 
| Verse his foreign policy. This too 
| laborious plot is the play's weak- 
| ness. It is over-simplified and at 
| many points unpersuasive. I could 
| wish that Capek had not built upon 
| 80 melodramatic a scaffolding, and, 


|above all, that he had not based | 


| the conversion of Krug and of the 
| dictator upon fear for their own 
skins. It is a mistake to imagine 
that one’s opponents are physical 
cowards, and a greater mistake,

CUT-UPS 


By B. R. CRISLER 
lot of an understudy is 
not a happy one. Abnormal

Nugent, this department's 
jeading man, two weeks ago con- 
tracted & deliberate and highly 
gelective form of disability; he ar- 
ranged to undergo @ throat opera- 
ation during a time which, in the 
most charitable spirit in the world, 
we can only describe as an off pe 
riod in the cinema. Now, as Mr, 
Nugent no doubt prudently foresaw, 
the disadvantage of a temporary 
joss of voice when there is nothing 
to talk about, is slight. How much 
slighter it becomes, therefore, in the 
ynlooked-for emergency of a seo 
ond recuperative week, when the 
only thing to write about is “‘Col- 
lege swing,’’ at the Paramount! We 
could almost find it in our heart 
to envy him his swabs, ice packs, 
and bis distant, convalescent calm. 
It couldn‘t have been last week, 
of course, when it would still have 
peen possible to say something 
about that delicious, 100 proof

At the outset, one thing must be 
very clear in the minds of the mak- 


|ers of educational and documentary 


films: the distinction between edu- 
cation and propaganda. The docu- 
mentary film is on the borderline 
between the two. It aims at estab- 
lishing a questioning outlook in the 
audience’s mind. It steps into the 
field of propaganda when it begins 
to induce the audience to adopt a! 
certain attitude toward facts and) 
opinions and involves the act of per- | 
suasion. I doubt if it is the job of 
the documentary film to make 
audiences accept conclusions. Rath-|

own conclusions. ws

The motion steture, with its un- 
limited powers of explanation and 
persuasion, has come along at an 
appropriate moment in world af- 
fairs. Under the democracies, edu- 
cation has shown an increasing 
need for new methods in the train- 
ing for citizenship. For all the val- 
uable experiments being made in 
progressive education, we must not 
ignore the fact that we have still, 
for the most part, an educational 
system which has little real contact 
with the vital social issues of our 
generation. 
Especially in the field of civics— 
of training for citizenship—do we 
find education without experience

than the French Jean Gabin and, 
therefore, must have a drama of 
softer hue. 

Further, with mistresses having 
no place in the American scene, ac- 
cording to the Hays production 
code, these characters have been 
altered. Gaby, who was played 
by Mireille Balin in the Paris edi- 
tion, was an unsympathetic char 
acter and was openly traveling in 
Algiers without benefit of clergy. 
Love has been refined in the cur 
rent epic and she is engaged to 
Giroux (Robert Grieg) and is ade- 
quately chaperoned. The character 
Ines is more glamorous in Sigrid 
Gurie’s conception than she was 
when Line Noro portrayed her; she 
has learned about soap and refrains 
from spitting on the floor. 

The French attempted to make 
a picture which would appeal to 
Americans, and their villains were 
done in the early Chicago gangster 
manner with about the results that 
would be expected. Wanger has 
converted them to French Colonial 
polyglots which, he believes, will 
add to realism. Although the pro- 
ducer purchased the American 
rights to the film as well as the 
story, no footage from the foreign 
edition wili be used. 

Some of the more interesting sets 
of the season mark the production.

IDNEY HOWARD'S valid and

tery of man’s battle with yel- 
low fever hes passed beyond 
the boy-meets-girl stage at Metro 
and this week was in the middie of 
the boy-loses-giri phase, with the 
studio anticipating that the cameras 
will focus on the boy-getsgirl dé- 
novement within « few days. Prom 
the pageant in which man’s search 
for knowledge was the hero and a 
dreadful scourge was the villain, 
Metro has culled the Cuban episode 
in which soldiers were the guinea 
pigs and has endowed Nurse Fran- 
ces Blake and Soldier John O'Hara, 
in the persons of Virginia Bruce 
and Robert Montgomery, with an 
ardor to the liking of movie fans. 
“Yellow Jack,” by Howard and 
Paul de Kruif, will therefore 
emerge in its cinematic version as 
a drama of personalities rather 

than an objective study of forces. 
Although the scientific flavor will 
be but a thin coating on the cellu- 
loid, the studio is making an ear- 
nest attempt to record the events 
that began at Quemado. Los An- 
geles having conquered the mos-

necessary to bring the larvae from

first film Julien Duvivier 
made was financed by a mus-

jwas a one-man job and Duvivier 
|was the man. He wrote it, directed 
it, constructed the sets, transported

jin an old ramshackle Ford and, 
when the cameraman fell ill, he shot 
all the scenes also. The film cost 
$1,500. The mustard manufacturer 
couldn’t get over it and finally 
went away to forget about it. 
Duvivier’s latest film, ‘Un Carnet

took the highest award at the 19387

However, MGM did bring Duvivier 
to Hollywood. 

What sort of person is the di- 
rector of ‘‘Un Carnet de Bal’? He 
likes animals seen from a distance, 
and poets seen close. He detests 
sports, has’a horror of crowds, 
weeps on seeing a football game, 
and is sleepy in night clubs. He 
adores tranquillity, the country, 
peace. He prefers Beethoven to 
Irving Berlin, and Conan Doyle to 
Schopenhauer. What he wishes 
mrost to achieve in his film is, as he 
puts it, ‘‘to touch the emotions.” 

He likes laughing in the theatre 
or at the movies but is not inter- 
ested in achieving this result in his 
own productions. He always en- 
deavors to redeem the poetic qual- 
ity of things. .The vilest person 
has his beauty.

“Perhaps Lady Peel will see me 
at 117” he asked. . 

“At 11," said the butler frigidly, 
“Her Ladyship turns over on the 
other side.’’ 

Also she has trouble with her 
lines, and the cold steel of the 
microphone strikes a chill into her 
bosom, But somehow she has been 
getting through nicely. The grim 
Nestors of Paramount, who have 
seen what has been done on the 
film, swore she was funny, and she 
stays on for another film or two. 

This is her third venture in Holly- 
wood, and instead of sinking she 
bobbed up. Her first was in Jack 
Pickford’s ‘‘Exit Smiling,’’ back in 

1926, an effort that was less than 
happy, and four years later she was 
in Are You There?’’—a title that 
seemed an apostrophe to a thin 
house. But Hollywood remembered 
that the lady was nowhere at fault, 
and that the plays erred in excess 
of politeness.

; ‘Doctor Rhythm” has a splendid 
| lack of restraint. Miss Lillie, you 
might say, plays her role broadly. 

She gets nipped by a ring-tailed 

monkey. She gets flung out of a 

Gypsy wagon. An operating-table 

on which she undergoes a massage 

collapses with the crash and final- 
ity of true art. 

The picture started off to be O. 
Henry’s ‘“‘The Badge of Policeman 
O'Roon,” the narrative got changed 
five or six times, but the general 
contour of its survives. Most of 
the doings swirl around Miss Lillie 
;as a brownstone dowager who 
| makes a cult of the police, and is a 
| deplorable case. Her den is jammed 
with clubs, machine-guns, sand- 
| bags, gyves, knuckle-dusters, tear- 
guns and straitjackets. 

““Ah,"’ says Crosby when he en- 
ters, ‘‘the nursery.” 

She asked Frank Tuttle, the di- 
rector, what might be her lines. He 
| said there weren't any. All the dia- 
logue had been taken out of the 
script and the dramaturgy was left 

to the gag-men. They did their in- 
sanest. The O’Roon gets into trou-

golden rule of silence.

change at that studio is the sub-

taire-Rogers opus.

DISSENTING OPINION 


A Voice From the Public 

| To the Screen Editor: 

It is most encouraging to note 
|that one of the leaders in the mo- 
tion-picture industry upon his re- 





turn from Europe (Samuel Gold- 


wyn) stated that the pictures pro- 


; duced in Hollywood were inferior to 
4 | those being produced in Europe. He 
= | deprecated the tremendous cost of 


| the so-called ‘‘A’’ and ‘“‘B”’ pictures 
| which turned out to be of the triple 
“p” type. 

Most of the pictures shown today 
}are an insult to one’s intelligence. 


Barbara Stanwyck has replaced | 
| Katharine Hepburn in RKO's ‘‘The | 
|Mad Miss Manton,”’ Miss Hepburn | 
| having objetted to making another | 
|comedy so close on the heels of | 


| THE NEW YORKER s@ys 


“That's a — tune. We'll work 
it in," said ttle. 

*"You can’t,” said the lady. ‘It’s 
from ‘The Gondoliers.’ But what's 


Bobby Vernon, the cherubie ex- 
comedian, emerged from a reverie 
and said a gypsy dance would do. 
There were a lot of fire and zip in it. 

“What's fair about that?’ asked 
Miss Lillie. ‘It’s taking advantage 
of the gypsies because they have no 
recognized government."’ 

The director telephoned a query 
to the front office, and all hands 
waited in a state of suspended ani- 
mation. The reply came in ten 
minutes, and Tuttle gave a decisive 
nod of the head. 

“The higher-ups say a gypsy 
dance is all right. Gypsies are bad 
movie customers.” 

A van was trundled to the set at 
once and the Romany interlude 
happily begun by heaving Miss Lil- 
He out of the door into a pool, 
knocking over a granddam, a dog 
and a tripod. Her aplomb wes in- 
tact. Not by so much as a twitch 
of her countenance did she bstray 
any hint that she was unfeelingly 
dealt with. Later she remrrked 
that acting before the camera was 
harder than acting on the stag® and 
that she'd like to choke people who 
thought otherwise.

Crosby is the raison d’étre of 
“Doctor Rhythm,” but he is aa un- 
assuming man and asks for no quar- 
ter, so Miss Lillie cuts loose as 
much as she pleases and doés al- 
most as much singing. If only she 
would end a ballad on the same 
pathetic note that she invariably 
begins it, but she won't. That's 
| where her brand of humor comes 
in. The first passage or two throb 
| with tender sentiment, and before 
she gets half way she is yowling 
half a note off key, but with her 
brash face set in anguished solem- 
nity. It is pure ridicule. And she 
gives you plenty of it in “Doctor 
Rhythm,” more than you’é get STA 
from her in three vaudeville nights, 
and it is the sort of thing that 
makes you glad that the movies 
were invented.

The Fusion of Rac 
Meeting on / 


By OLIN DOWNES 

VERY kir d reader, in a letter 
too long to be reprinted here, 

asks, apropos of last Sun 
day's account of certain com-& 
tions and theories of the late 
Henry F. Gilbert. how any com 
poser, oF writer, for that matter 
ean seriously suggest the develop- 
ment of our native musical art 
pased upon so-called “American 
folk-music. He asks where a gen 
uinely American folk-music is to be 
found, remarking, as often has been 
remarked before. that aside from 
folk-tunes of Indians and Negroes 
the white races of America have not 
uced any distinctive communal! 
music of their own. How, then, are 
American symphonies and operas 
to be written on the basis of some 
fancied form of national dance or 


song” 
o-@ 2 


“You say that Gilbert was ‘eter- 
nally right.’ Where is the proof of 
that? If the legendary Anglo 
Saxons, one of the least musical 

ple on earth, had produced mu- 
sic which became a tradition of 
the people, there might be a basis 
for a theory of composition spring 
ing from such a source. The mod 
ern English school, in the instances 
of Vaughan Williams or Arnold 
Bax, have done things in this line. 
But even these composers do not 
make the sum or substance of con- 
temporaneous British composition. 
Unless a melody is vividly present 
in the minds and hearts of a pop 
ulation, it has no more to do with 
their musical consciousness than 
the folk-tune of an Indian fakir 

“We live in a modern age 
favorable anyhow to the growth of 
naive music which might well be 
termed the expression of the child- 
hood of a race. For, when self- 
consciousness enters in, 
art disappears. Foilk-musio is an 
untutored product. The musical 
printing press, the modern pubDlish- 
er, the age of communications and 
transportation 
completely taken away our inno 
cence of outlook. We in Amer- 
ica, particularly, represent no long- 
er a ‘folk’ or community suffi- 
ciently isolated from other com- 
munities to form its own indi- 
vidual ‘folk’ expression, as, for in- 
stance, the highly individualized 
and relatively isolated provinces of 
Spain have done up to the present 
day. Particularly is an American 
an international composite. He }s, 
moreover, by disposition a sightseer 
and observer of the world. What 
originality he may have possessed 
for communal expression is disap- 
pearing, as rapidly as wireless, air 
lines and cheap travel rates on 
railroads and ocean steamers are 
extending hie range of vision. The 
modern artist faces a far more com- 
plicated problem than that of the 
Glinkas and Mussorgskys in Rus- 
sia, or the Dvoraks of Bohemia and 
Griegs of Norway, of an earlier 
epoch. The American {is too mod- 
ern, too kinetic, too contemporane- 
ous in all his thinking and doing 
for him to express himseif in terms 
of a simple and untutored art of 
past period. In music, as in other 
expressions, he must look aheat 
and not behind him." 

* * * 

We arestill on the other side of 
the fence. In the first place, 
broader interpretation must be pu 
upon the term ‘“‘folk-art’’ or ‘folk 
music”’ than that of a purely loca 
and traditional expression. Folk 
musio of one sort or another, es 
sentially speaking, is always form 
ing and multiplying its manifest 
tions. The term should be take 
as meaning, efundamentally, 4! 
musie that a people or a natio 
adopt as their own. The strict def 
nition of a folk-tune has been 
melody of ancient and unknow 
origin, orally communicated, to be 
come a part of the musica! thin 
ing of a community or race. T 
time when that process could tak 
Place naturally has largely passed 
But the time when human being 
sing and think In musical tern 
can never pass. Gilbert once mad 
the succinct observation that ‘mu 
sic is coeval with the human race 
which is undoubtedly true. Musi: 
organisms form in the human min¢ 
as inevitably as organisms fort 
in water. Put a quantity of ster! 
ized water, enough not to evap

that is folk-music. A few of th

VERY ki: 4 reader, in a letter |

Henry F. Gilbert, how any com-

folk-tunes of Indians and Negroes, 
the white races of America have not

music of their own. How, then, are 
American symphonies and operas 


are incorporated in the body of a 
national folklore. The seeds of 
|folk-musie are flung to the wind. 
If the soil is propitious, they grow. 
A German folksong becomes **Mary- 
land, My Maryliand.’’ Where did we 
get “Turkey in the Straw’? It 
isn't @ negroid, or “Ethiopian,” 
moet — as they would have 
| pu n Foster's day, but probably 
nr Celtic Seahtalinghalicn . 

These different organisms of folk- 
music follow the laws of other 
forms of life. Given propinquity, 
they amalgamate. Russian folk- 
musie, English and French folk- 
music—how many widely separated 
sources of melody are involved! 

It is surely evident that a national 
musical art mnst rise from a pop- 


to be written on the basis of some | ular base, and not consist of forms 
fancied form of national dance or superimposed from more rarefied 


song’ 
° & e 

“You say that Gilbert was ‘eter- 
pally right.’ Where is the proof of 
that? If the legendary Anglo- | 
Saxons, one of the least musical

regions overhead. The pulse and 
pith of a living art seldom originate 
from circles where the conditions 
are safe and secure for culture. 
The most elaborate music rests in 
the last analysis upon popular 
forms of expression. Old and very 
simple dance tunes evolved into 
Bach suites. But it is even increas- 
ingly evident that the European 
musical culture is at the end of an 
epoch, while ours in America is just 
on the threshold of its history. 

In the meantime what has hap- 
pened with, or in, our symphonies? 
Why are they not harkened to, 
overseas as wel] as at home? That

ORE thar 500 participants 
from twenty-nine States will 
gather in Constitution Hall, 
Washington, D. C., this Friday for 
a three-day folk festival announced 
as the most complete ever staged 
in this country. There will be three 


afternoon and a% many evening pro | 


grams, each representing a crose- 
section of a definite field of Ameri- 
can folklore. 

Five Indian tribes will send musi- 
elans, singers end dancers to the 
festival, namely, the Navajos, Kio- 
was, Blackfeet, Chickasaws and 
Winnebagos. These Indians will ap- 
pear on all of the programs, al- 
though the delegation will be seen 
in its entirety only in the corn cere- 
monials, in which they will be led 
by a Chickasaw princess. Full tra- 
ditional costumés will be worn. 

Ancient folk plays, songs, guitar 
numbers and dances will be offered 
by Mexican-Spanish groups from 
New Mexico, Texas and Our Lady 
of Guadaloupe Center of Kansas 
City, Mo. Mormons from Utah will 
sing pioneer songs used by their 
ancestors of the westward trek, and 
Dunkards from Maryland and 
Plainsong Charters from Kentucky 
will be heard in religious numbers.

weeks and presented 108 concerts, 

With the exception of five mid- 
Winter weeks, which were taken 
over by Georges Enesco, the sea- 
son was under the baton of Mr. 
Barbirolli, who today completes his 
first year as permanent conductor. 
While Ernest Schelling was in 
Switzerland convalescing from an 
eye injury, the first of the youth 
concerts was conducted by Mr. 
Barbiro}jli, the other five by Ru- 
dolph Gans. 

The orchestra was assisted by 
thirty-five soloiste—thirteen pian- 
ists, ten violinists, eight vocalists, 
two ‘cellists, one English horn 
| player and one trumpet player. 
|The services of two choruses were 
| required. 

The season offered 445 per 
| formances of 183 works of seventy- 
\five composers. These composers 
jwere of fifteen nationalities. As 
jone would imagine, Germany came 
first with eleven. But for second 
| Place this country broke even 
with France and Russia with ten 
composers: Samuel Barber, Charles 
Wakefield Cadman, Abram Chasins, 
MacDowell, Quinto Maganini, Dan- 
jel Gregory Mason, Walter Piston, 
Quincy Porter, Gardiner Read and 
Deems Taylor. (Last year the Unit- 
ed States tied for fourth place with 
England, with seven composers.) 

Englani came third with eight 
composers; then, in order, were 
Italy, Rumania (obviously Enesco’s 
influence) ; Austria (meaning 
| Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Johann 
| Strauss); Hungary, Czechoslovakia, 
Belgium, Spain, with two composers 
each; Bohemia, Poland, Finland, 
with one each.

tract. From time to time I experi 
ment a little, but always I come 
back to the operas which pleased 
the people a generation ago. I have 
had an opportunity to study public 
taste and I find that in grand opera 
it doesn't change with the wind as 
it does with the ‘movies’ and the 
spoken drama. 

‘The public, of course, changes. 
Young people are coming to hear 
our performances—thousands of 
young people who have never had 
a chance to hear Verdi and Puccini

to forty weeks a year—20,000 to 
30,000 miles of traveling — ‘‘Aida,”’ | 
“Carmen,” ‘‘Lohengrin,” ‘‘La Bo-

500,000 to 750,000 listeners annually.

RECENT RECORDINGS 


By COMPTON PAKENHAM 


ITH a remarkably short 
time elapsed since its re- 
cording and only three 


years after .ts first per- 
formance, Victor gives domestic re- 
lease to Vaughan Williams's sym- 
phony in F minor, played by the 
British Broadcasting Orchestra un- 
der the composer’s personal direc- 
tion (Album M-440). The times are) 
noted in passing, only for the rea- 
son that, apart from Roy Harris, 
we cannot remember an American 
coraposer receiving such treatment. 

The symphony is not unknown 
here. Six months after it was in- 
troduced to London, by this same 
B. C. C. Orchestra, Artur Rod- 
zinsky played it in Cleveland, and 
New York has heard it at least 
twice. In each case its reception 
was f:.vorable. Comments on the 
music of Vaughan Williams do not 
carry the tone of reserved respect 
that pervaded Elgar notices. One 
can afford to overlook the fact that 
Vaughan Williams is the present 
doyen of British music. He sings 
without a trace of self-conscious- 
ness and the result can be taken 
for what it is. 

With a firm basis in folk, 
Vaughan Williams builds from his 
own experience and impressions. 
His themes are short and stout. If 
any tendency can be noted it is 
that he is abreast of his sounder, 
more virile contemporaries. He is 
natural, free and essentially hon- 
est. In this symphony one doesnot 
find him idling or wasting time 
laying on successive coats of noth- 
Something definite is ever 


Mstening to ‘“‘The Triumph of Nep- 
tune,”” at any rate for the first 
time. Working in familiar dance 
rhythms, Berners dresses a series 
of reminiscent tunes in unexpected, 
occasionally even startling colors. 
At a first hearing the curiosity is 
piqued, but it does not take many 
repetitions for the novel touches to 
lose their bite. The whole business 
is highly entertaining, and Sir 


| Thomas gives it a rollicking per- 


formance. 

One hag learned to expect more 
or less anything from Egon Petri, 
but the Tchaikovsky concerto in B 
flat minor (Op. 23) comes as some- 
what of a surprise. With him, in 
this, is the London Philharmonic 
under Walter Goehr’s direction. 
The broad ecstatic introduction, 
that arouses expectations never ful- 
filled, is a grand test of recording 
and reproduction, and it might be 
taken for granted that Petri would 
play the previous Columbia set out 
of existence. So indeed he does, 
and we now have the choice be- 
tween two quite exceptional record- 
ings; for, despite its age, that made 
by Artur Rubinstein and the Lon- 
don Symphony (Barbirolli) still 
holds its own. 

Jack Caidin, who hag managed 
his cut-out record business from a 
part-time hobby until it has become 
the Collectors Record Shop, issues 
a Victor-recorded disk on his own 
account. It carries ‘‘Questa o quella”’ 
from ‘‘Rigoletto”’ and ‘‘Recondita 
Armonia,’”’ from the first act of 
“Tosca,”’ well sung by Enrico 
Caruso Jr. In his youth, with no 
idea of any serious results, Caruso

IN THE 


’ WEIGHING ‘PI 


Exhibition at the M 
And Independents 


EW YORK seems all at once 
aswarm with ‘primitives.’ 
And since there are so 
many of them, and since 
thére will not be time today to delve 


quotes be dropped. The term it- 

gelf has been pretty widely accepted 

signifying an equivalent for 

tres Populaires de la 

; and because that quaint 

oven when shortened to the 

‘Masters of Popular Paint- 

long for constant use, 

as well to slip in 

q¥o without a qualm 

best term of all, and 

bly the shortest, is “folk,” 

has ,—ae to denote, in a 

special sense, the household art of 

century pr an ours. Thus 

we are sure we know what we 
mean, primitive will serve. 

There seems something almost 
inspired, though I am sure there 
is nothing collusive, in the fact that 
two exhibitions of primitive art 
should have opened at the same 
time. Reference is made, of course, 
to the “Masters of Popular Paint- 
ing’’ at the Museum of Modern Art 
and—with perhaps a shade less ob- 
vious right to take that for granted 
—the twenty-second Annual of the 
Society of Independent Artists at 
the Grand Central Palace. 
objected that the Independent ar- 
tists are by no means, all of them, 
primitive? This year, at any rate, 
happens to be a good one in which 
to sift. And, even without having 
made a thorough attempt to put the 
sheep and goats asunder, I yet saw 
enough in a reasonably conscien- 
tious tour of the Palace on Tues 
day last fo persuade me that, foot- 
ing results of visits to both exhi- 
bitions, New York is aswarm with 


primitives. 
* * « 


HERE is, to be sure, a con- 
T spicuous difference between 

the huge sifted group of prim!- 
tive painters in the show put on 
by the Society of Independent Ar- 
tists and the relatively small group 
of pre-sifted primitive painters, Eu 
ropean and American, at the Mu- | 
seum of Modern Art. This differ- 
ence has to do with quality. 

The Independent primitives lack, 
in large measure, those qualities 
that distinguish the primitives, e» 
pecially the European primitives,

I shall try to return to the Palace 
in a little while, but at the outset 
let it remain that for the most part 
our homespun annua! aspirants fall 
short of museum rating. 

Now, what qualities have been 
sought and found in the primitives 
whose work makes imperative « 
visit to the Museum of Modern Art? 
In an earlier report I alluded to 
Alfred Barr's remark that only 
since the apotheosis of Henri Rous 
seau have individual popular artists 
been taken seriously. And in order 
to make clear the qualitative con- 
trast between one sort of primitive 
and the other it will be advisable 


have created any very great impres-

WEIGHING ‘PRIMITIVE’ ART 
Exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art 


And Independents’ 


By EDWARD ALLEN JEWELL 
EW YORK seems all at once 
aswarm with ‘‘primitives."’ 
And since there are 60 
many of them, and since 
thire will not be time today to delve 
far into speculation upon what a 
“primitive” really is and what he 
is not, from this point on let the 
quotes be dropped. The term it- 
gelf has been pretty widely accepted 
es signifying an equivalent for 
“Lee MAitres Populaires de la 
Réalité’; and because that quaint 
tag, even when shortened to the 
English ‘Masters of Popular Paint- 
” is too long for constant use, 
it will be just as well to slip in 
the quid pro quo without a qualm. 
Arguably the best term of all, and 
ynarguably the shortest, is ‘‘folk,” 
put that has come to denote, in a 
special sense, the household art of 
the century preceding ours. Thus 
if we are sure we know what we 
mean, primitive will serve. 

There seems something almost 
inspired, though I am sure there 
is nothing collusive, in the fact that 
two exhibitions of primitive art 
ghould have opened at the same 
time. Reference is mads, of course, 
to the “Masters of Popular Paint- 
ing’ at the Museum of Modern Art 
and—with perhaps a shade less ob- 
vious right to take that for granted 
—the twenty-second Annual of the 
fociety of Independent Artists at 
the Grand Central Palace. Is it 
objected that the Independent ar- 
tists are by no means, all of them, 
primitive? This year, at any rate, 
happens to be a good one in which 
to sift. And, even without having 
made a thorough attempt to put the 
sheep and goats asunder, I yet saw 
enough in a reasonably conscien- 
tious tour of the Palace on Tues- 
day last fo persuade me that, foot- 
ing results of visits to both exhi- 
bitions, New York is aswarm with 


primitives. 
* s 


HERE is, to be sure, @ con- 

spicuous difference between 

the huge sifted group of primi- 
tive painters in the show put on 
by the Society of Independent Ar- 
tists and the relatively small group 
of pre-sifted primitive painters, Eu- 
ropean and Amerfean, at the Mu- 
geum of Modern Art. This differ- 
ence has to do with quality. 
The Independent primitives lack, 
in large measure, those qualities

the altogether amazing “‘Open Sea,” 
the ‘‘Foggy Sea’’ and ‘‘Villers-sur-

way, supreme. Bauchant’'s talent 
is illustrated so as to reveal its sev- 
eral facets, and outstanding among 
his pictures are those in which he 
explores classical and _ religious 
themes, especially eloquent being 
“The Treachery of Judas.”’ 

Doubt as to the qualification of 
some of the European artists in- 
cluded arised repeatedly—euch quali- 
fication estimated on the score of 
their being considered, in the full 
and strict sense, primitive. No real 
doubt attaches to Vivin, even when 
he exhibits—as in ‘Wild Boar 
Chased by Dogs’’. and “Deer in 
| Snow’’—so uncanny a grasp of the 
| principles of decorative stylization.

Water-Colors :nd Pastele — Mad] 
Hooper LaFarge, who used to paint 
with her celebrsted father-in-law, is 
showing water-colors at the Walker 
Gallery (till May 14). These flowers 
and interiors sre expertly done— 
smooth, sure and decorative. Papers 
such as the “White Iris, Cameilia 
and Shell,” and ‘“‘Grapes and Pep- 
per’ speak for themselves. 

“Down in Majne’”’ is the accurate 
and homely title of the water-color 
sketches by Philip von Saltza, on 
view at Macbeth’s (until May 8). 
Children flying kites or helping 
their mothers get water from the 
pump for wash day; a child being 
bathed in the farmhouse kitchen; 
the butcher with his traveling shop 
whose advent mieans a bone for the 
household dog: in these quotidiana 
of the back country the artist has 
found his themes and made them 
saltily human. And the papers are 
soundly constructed. 

Virginia Berresford, whose semi- 
abstract style has become familiar 
to New York gallery-goers, is hold-

a vision recorded with as much 
faithfulness as an tinschooled brush 
can contrive, or imaginatively 
altered so as to express, with child- 
like zeal, a naive, a sometimes righ- 
ly poetic, love of masquerade? 

The distinction need not be la- 
bored, since if we become too en- 
grossed in the ‘‘problem”’ of primi- 
tive art we are in danger of missing 
its delight. Maximilien Gauthier, 
also a contributor to the museum's 
catalogue, communicates an infec- 
tious enthusiasm, though he tends 
perhaps to magnify the stature of 
these charming primitives; and it 
may be difficult for some of us to 
go the whole way with him when 
he talks of masterpieces that dem-| 
onstrate not alone the presence of | 
“a very powerful instinct” but even | 
of ‘‘genius.’" To paint, he declares, 
without the slightest attention to 
the intellectual conventions which 
have dominated art since the 
Renaissance is to pass beyond 
the artificers, whom Montaigne 
denounced, to rejoin Giotto, 
Pierro della Francesca and the 
Master of Villeneuve, and to carry 

on their work. 
No one -vould wish art to be bound 
and gagged by sti.ling precedent 


with respect to the beautiful, deli- 
cate tracery of ‘‘Morning on the 
Lake,’ are we tempted to debate 
the primitive standing of Adolf 
Dietrich. Bat Jean Eve's delicious- 
ly fresh ‘‘Boulevard Saint-Denis at 
Courbevoie”’ and “Gypsy Encamp- 
ment’—are they more primitive 
than the work of Uttillo’s brush? 
Does the accomplished René Rim- 
bert, save in certain minor respects, 
seem primitive at ali? 

The case of Camille Bombois is 
complex. He undoubtedly started as 
a bona fide primitive, and in many 
respects he is a primitive still; but 
the later works, high in color and 
(if uniformly weak in rhythm) so 


| bold and assertive as to pattern, | 


would seem to indicate primitive 
methods harnessed and consciously 
employed to attain results correlated 
with — not ‘‘exploitation,’’ necessa- 
rily, in the more blatant market 
sense of the term, but with, or af- 
fected by, the plaudits of sophisti- 
cated admirers. In this, of course, I 
may be wrong. " 
The American section, as a whole, 
fails to reach the heights achieved 
by the European, although Holger 
Cahill appears quite justified in re-

that need here be added to the com-

upon the numerically strong primi- 
tive element encountered in the 
show of the Independent artists 
(the exhibition as a whole was 
noticed at some length last Thurs- 
day morning). It should be noted, 
however, that several of these 
primitives reveal conspicuous gifts 
of imagination or craft of a highly 
developed order (and sometimes 
these virtues are found teamed).

Allen Townsend Terrell. In this, his 
New York debut, Mr. Terrell dis. 
plays ability to individualize his 
subjects who have sat for portrait 
heads. His figures possess both 
grace and strength. Classic antiq- 
uity and eighteenth-century French 
sculpture have been influences, one 
ventures to point out, and a num- 
ber of the pieces have a linear 
beauty and charm that now and 
again suggest kinship with De 
spiau. The strong and well realized 
portrait of the artist's father 
(bronze) and a small figure in 
plastic marble are among the out- 
standing pieces. It is a very auspi- 
cious first show.

ART IN OUR 


DAILY LIVES 


Esthetic Considerations That Reach Out 
Into Housing, Utilities and Other Fields 


By RUTH. GREEN HARRIS 
doesn’t matter what beard you 
spring from—the modern bath- 
room, housing, radios, railroads, 
chaire—you can, if you are so 
minded, take a header into ques 
tions of esthetics. Or starting with 
esthetics, a science all civilization 
has been engaged in trying to ex- 
plain, you can swim around in 
benign ethical, moral, symbolic, 
religious, gastronomic, elimatic, 
economic circles and without the 
least strain arrive back at the mod- 
ern bathroom, housing, radios, rail- 
roads, chairs. | 

There has been much conversation | 
on this page, and there is likely to} 
be much more, about the good | 
economy of using the artist, of put- 
ting him to work on the important 

objects of our daily use because h 
profession deals with « profound 
shapeliness of things. Shapeliness 
means space economically used, 
space not wasted for any frivolous 
reason. 

When Buckminster Fuller cooper- 
ates with Buckminster Fuiler, art- 
igt cooperates with engineer. This 
combination, so essential to success- 
ful designing, is rarely found oper-| 
ating within one man. When it is, | 
we may be provided with yet an- 
other definition of genius. Neither 
scientist nor artist is completely 
one or the other unless he is thor- 
oughly both. 

Buckminster Fuller is thoroughly | 
both.’ You doubtless remember the | 
efficient “di-maxion’’ house he de- | 
signed; also the efficient car. We 
are a frivolous people not to have 
made better use of these. Now 
there is a Buckminster Fuller bath- 
room, instead of a whole house. It 
may serve as a snare to lure us ulti- 
mately into the ‘house itself, by 
feeding our American passion for 
extravagant cleanliness. 


HE room was brought not long 

ago into Isamu Noguchi's court: | 

yard, a forgotten courtyard, 
overlooked by a haphazardly grow- 
ing city. When the city of the fu- 
ture reaches this small area there 
will be less need for wasteful de- 
molishing than in areas adjacent 
to it. 

In the rainy courtyard, where) 
this new bathroom was exhibited, 
people waited under umbrellas for 
a chance to enter: painters, sculp- 
tors, an art dealer, a landlady, a) 
violinist and his wife, engineers, | 
journalists. From the engnneer's 
point of view, Fuller's job was pro- 
nounced perfect. Preper materials | 





had been used in the most practical scheme, 
way; pipes were in the right place, | one 


at the right angle; the heating sys- 
tem was faultless; the thing was) 
cheap and easy to install; it weighed 
not an unnecessary ounce, and so 
on and so on—which led to manu- 
facturing and engineering questions 
too technical for this reviewer to 
follow. 

But from our point of view the en- 
thusiasm of artists was even more 
important. Curiously enough, a 
sequence of convex forms, ~~ 
logically into one another, helped 
explain certain aspects of convex | 
sculpture that had seemed, up to | 
this time, obscure.

MU NOGUCHI has designed 

something called a radio nurse, 

a sort of private radiophone to 

be carried from one room to an- 

other, keeping you in touch with all 


| 


the sounds that issue from the nurs. | 


. As a matter of fact, I mis 
took the beautiful, head-shaped ob- 
iject for a piece of abstract sculp- 
ture. 

The question cf radio nurses led 
conversation on to radios. The ar 
tist sees no reason why radios must 
be either Chippendale or ‘‘modern- 
istic."’ He sees no reason why they 
should not be radios, designed from 
the inside out, like a good portrait 
or a good bathroom or a good city. 
And as this page has urged 80 | 
often. before, the element of giving 
delight is one of the conditions of | 

oodness.

beyond belief. Do things to be

T would require a hardy soul, 
indeed, to recommend attend- 
ance at the WPA production 
of “Trojan Incident’’ at the St. 
James Theatre, for, truth to tell, it 
is only the dances of Tamiris, sup- 
ported by the admirable musical 
score of Wallingford Riegger, that 
keep it from transforming one of 
the world’s greatest dramas into in- 
advertent farce. These redeeming 
elements, however, prompt one toa 
qualified recommendation of attend- 
ance, especially for those who are 
interested in the development of the 
theatre and dance along a common 
path. Certainly there is something 
of notability in the fact that here 
Broadway is given its first view in 
nearly twenty years of a Greek 
chorus that at least approximates | 
what a Greek chorus should be. 
Considering the obstacles against 
which Tamiris has had to contend 
(as co-director, is she not also in 
part responsible for them?) she has 
done yeoman service with the 
dance, for only in the choral odes 
does the production strike fire 
and touch at all upon emotional ex- 
citement. These obstacles consist 
not merely in such comparatively 
minor issues as poor casting, but 
are basically due to the fact that 
behind the production itself ap- 
pears no concept of the essential 
structure of choral drama, or more 
particularly of the ‘Trojan 4 


men"’ of Euripides. Fundamentally,

The first ane exhibition of) 
painting and sculpture of the New 
Hudson River Group w'll open this 


forcing. 


An American Group directs the 
purpose of the same material. Emo- 
jtional quality is heightened by 
painting, sculpture, prints, which | 
bear on the subject, housing. 

This, unlike so many ‘theme 
shows,”’ has not been hurt by 
Forty million live under 
roofs; onethird of a nation is 
poorly housed, poorly clad, poorly 
|fed. Housing, like love, death, 
birth, is a universal theme. ‘‘Roofs 
for 40 Million’ is the most im- 
| Portant group exhibition of work by 
|Americans that has taken place 
this season. 


for the dance in a Greek drama 
does not consist of separable inter- 
ludes, but is actually the nucleus 
of the whole work. It is of sec- 
ondary importance, in so far as the 
dance is concerned, that the lan- 
guage of the present version is 
gauche and unmusical; what mat- 
ters greatly is that in the ruthless 
cutting the structure of the work 
has been demolished. This struc- 
ture is not, as in many plays even 
of the Greeks, a matter of linear 
plot development; the story has all 
been enacted before the curtain 
|rises. The play itself is a great 
| threnody, developed by the juxta- 





Dr. Harshe was best known for | 


| his work as director of the institute 


and few of his friends knew that 
most of his spare time was spent | 
in painting. He is represented in 


the Luxembourg, and in the Las | 


Angeles and Brooklyn museums.

An exhibition of portraits by Sig- 


position of themes, almost like the 
movements of a symphony, in a 


has put a mark of distinction upon 
the present sorry production. 
She has achieved a dozen glowing 


moments when the dancing lifts the | 


scene into terms of universal emo- 
tion, transmuting the surface stuff 
of the Trojan myth into its under- 
lying realities and touching into 
fire experiences of the mind as/| 
common to us as to the Greeks of | 
twenty-five centuries ago. 

The groping bewilderment of the 
parados should by all rights be 
danced instead of being reduced to 
scattered and static conversation. It 
is here that the play begins and on 
these initial rhythms it must form 
its pattern. We are then prepared 
for the tremendous ordeal of Cas-| 


sandra, a mad, prophetic dance-song | c 


which is by all odds the most diffi- 
cult acene of the play. To Tamiris's 
great credit, it emerges in the pres- 
ent production as the most satisfac- 
tory scene of the evening. For the 
dance she has evolved movements 
of power and conviction—a strange, 
terrible dance, pointed ironically by | | 
the torches of Hymen. 

There are excellent and intuitive 
phrases in the chorus which here 
begins: ‘‘This is the song of the 
horse."’ It builds to exciting cli- 
maxes, and its materials are origi- 
nal and vigorous. 

There are mood and color in the 
lament after the death of Astyanax, 
for all that one misses the variety 
that the full ode provides with its 
tale of the earlier sacking of Troy 
by Alcmena’s son. From the early 
phrases of the following ode there 
are likewise missing the colors of 


| desolation, but it achieves a fine 


fervor in its denunciation of Helen. 

Discussion of the difficulties of 
bridging the styles of the choric 
odes and the dialogue scenes, of the 
virtues and perils of dividing the 
choruses between separate groups 
of dancers and singers, and the va- 
rious other problems which beset 
this most fascinating of theatre- 
dance forms, must await another 
opportunity. For the present it is 
perhaps enough to vote a laurel te 
Tamiris for a creative and imagi- 
native piece of work against the 
most Sormaitente = ee.

This contest, according to Statiog

where the water drops over a 13

SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF DERBY DAY AT CHURCHILL DOWNS 


Records in Attendance, Entertainment and Racing Expected to 
Fall at Churchill Downs, ‘Horse Heaven,’ Next Saturday 


By TOM BR. UNDERWOOD 
LourmsvILus. 

HE annua! pilgrimage to Ken- 

tucky—‘‘horse heaven’’— has 

begun, and by Derby Day, 

next Saturday, Churchill 
Downs will look from a distance 
like a field of straw ripening in the 
breese, s0 great will be the bobbing 
of new hot-weather hats. From be- 
neath them will be a murmuring 
babel of ‘‘Menow, ‘Bull Lea, Stage- 
hand and Fighting Fox,” and of 
“straight, place and show,” rising 
in crescendo to the tumultuous cry 
of “They’re off!’ that echoes 
around the world. 

A record crowd of about 100,000 
is expected to be present at this | 
year’s Derby. There will be special 
trains from Chicago, New York, 
Detroit, Washington and other 
cities, Other visitors will come by 
river and air. Always, however, au- 


tomobiles bring the largest num-| 





bers, and license tags from every 
State may be seen. 

The visiting horde will find itself 
in the inevitable last-minute traffic 
jam, broken only when motor-cycled 
State patrolmen whisk celebrities 
through to box seats that neither 
“love nor money”’ can buy, once all 
have been sold out. 

This year, for the first time, Ken- 
tucky Derby Day at Churchill 
Downs is to be an all-day affair. 
The racing association has an- 
nounced plans for at least nine 
races beginning before noon, s0 
that picnicking will vie with horse- 
picking during the day. 


Center Field Open 

What is more, all who desire will 
be permitted to go to the center 
field, where the lawn has been ter- 
raced, and so all will have some 
chance of seeing the race. Hereto- 
fore people have been so packed 
within the gates that many have 
been unable to see. The story is! 
told of a Chicagoan who sat back 
of the grandstand and wept lugubri- 
ously last year, saying: ‘‘I’ve been 
going to Derbys for twenty years 
and never have seen one yet.’’ Use 
of the center field will remedy that. 

The Derby Cup this year will be 
presented in the center field, in pub- 
lic view, instead of in what has 
come to be known as ‘‘the charmed 
circle,"’ a chalked line in the club- 
house. Governor A. B. Chandler of 
Kentucky will present the cup, 
which in previous years has often 
been handed the winning owner by 
some out-of-State notable. After 
Gallant Fox had won the Derby it 
was the Earl of Derby who made 
the presentation to the horse's 
owner, William Woodward. The 





| Earl at that time ended forever the 
ware Water Gap, the Poconos oF | argument over whether to call it | Only in that manner could he keep 


‘“‘Durby”’ or ‘‘Darby.’’ He called it | 
“Darby,” then quickly apologized. | 
Two Noted Parades 

At Churchill Downs on the day of 
the race there are two Derby pa- 
rades. One is the famous parade 
to the, post following the bugle call 
of ‘‘Boots and Saddiles."’ The horses, 
under silks, emerge from the pad- 
dock, with a mounted guard as es- 
cort, pass the stands twice in going 
to the barrier. As the horses come 
out a band plays “My Old Ken- 
tucky Home,” and all stand to wit- 
ness the parade to the post. 

The other Derby perade, equally 


colorful, is the fashipn parade, for | 
| Derby Day is a style festival here- | 


Side Trips by Visitors 


about. Louisville’s social leaders 
shop early for Derby Day; they 
must have their pictures taken 
more than a week in advance if 








they are to appear in the rotogra- 


pers that greet the Derby crowds 
with their display of Derby styles.

taken principally with mint juleps. 
The mint crop is early this year 
and the tender blades of that mek 
lifluous weed have reached just the 
exact length to extend from the 
bottom of a silver cup and hide 
completely the nose of a colonel. 

As a matter of fact, Kentucky 
colonels will not be in their fullest 
bloom, inasmuch as Governor 
Chandler has not named a single 
colonel since assuming office. How- 
ever, at the Derby eve banquet of 
the Kentucky Colonels Society in 
Louisville he will relent by appoint- 
ing ten. 


All Equal on Turf 


Other titles matter little at 


| Churchill Downs on Derby Day, for 


the saying goes that ‘‘on the turf as 
under the turf all men are equal.” 
In the crowded stands and near 
the paddock where the Derby con- 
testants are saddled, the Liberty 
Leaguer may look on the same pro- 


|gram with the WPA worker, Wall 


Street may seek a tip from Shady 
Lane, the saint may ask the sinner 
how to unravel the mysteries of 
“form and past performances” and 
the glamour girl may learn froni 
the farmer's daughter whether she 
thinks Mountain Ridge is a sprinter 
or stayer while the bootblack is ex- 
plaining to the absent-minded pro- 
fessor how to pronounce Nedayr. 

Governors of six States already 
have signified their intention of at- 
tending next Saturday, and Gover- 
nor Chandler will keep open house 
at the Governor’s Mansion for 
them and other distinguished 
guests. 

Louisville has already begun to 
feel the rush of people who annu- 
ally overwhelm it at Derby time. 
Here, during the rush, hotel rooms 
are at a premium and “a com- 
modity price rise’’ above the gen- 
eral level often is noted. Roll a 
Fifth Avenue Easter parade, a 
Hollywood first night, a rural 
county court day, a mountain laurel 
festival and a great union meeting 
together, pack all the people be- 
tween two furlong poles and make 
them all simultaneously yell, ‘‘Come 
on!’’—and you have a Derby scene, 
at the finish of the grueling mile 
and a quarter that makes turf his- 
tory. 

Watching the Workouts 

In this picture, after all, it is 
horseflesh that counts most. And 
these days, at morning workouts, 
crowds swarm Churchill Downs. 
Earl Sande, who-has ridden three 
Derby winners and is training 
Stagehand and The Chief, had to 
build a fence around the training 
stable where Stagehand is kept; 


sightseers away, An exercise boy 


winner, often to be found within a 
few miles of Lexington, which is 
eighty miles from Louisville on 
U. 8S. 60, is visited by throngs and 
led forth by a Negre stable attend- 
ant to lift his bead in regal 
splendor. 

Many tourists whe come to Ken- 
tucky for the Derby will visit the 
Old Kentucky Home at Bardstown, 
just south of Louisville; Abraham 
Lincoln's birthplace at Hodgenville, 
or Mammoth Cave. Or perhaps 
they will drop over t» near-by Camp 
Knox, where most 2f the nation’s 
gold is stored—one store of money 
that will not changs hands on the 
Kentucky Derby. 


YPRES CELEB 


By BERNHARD RAGNER 
- | Ypaes. 
TRAGIC destiay has pursued 
Ypres, the one-time capital 
of Western Flanders. The 
Niobe of Belgian cities! Ex- 
cept for infermissions devoted to 
peace and progress, to serve as a 
battleground for nations ha’ been 
its sacrificial role. Often 
““Wipers,"’ as the British soldiers 
pronounced it, tasted the sweet 
wine of glory and then the bitter 
wormwood of desvlation and de 
spair.

same time it is observing the twen- 
tieth anniversary of the last bettle 
of Ypres (there were no fewer than 
four in the course of the World 
War) and two decades of liberation 
from the yoke of the alien invader. 
The celebrations, evoking medi- 
eval pageantry and color, will be as 
gay, as striking, as picturesque as 
Flemish ingenuity can make them. 
But they will be conditioned by the 


jured.

win the Derby this year equivocal | nes endured.” That sentence, 


replies must be given; there is al- 
ways an element of uncertainty 
about horse racing. However, a tip 
of another nature is pretty gen- 
erally going the rounds: The Blue 
Grass may be blue this year at 
Derby time! Usually visistors are 
disappointed to find Kentucky's 
blue grass still green, but this 
year’s early Spring may have the 
effect of speeding its seed time, 
when it has its bluish hue. 


This probability will cause many 
more than usual, in the beemingly 


|endless motorcades that annually 
f the Northern | Vure sections of Louisville newspa-|flock to the Kentucky Derby, to 


swing through the Blue Grass horse 
country to see the thoroughbred 
farms where future Derby winners 
romp and play. Annually thousands 


tates on their way to the Derby; 


dated 
1689, is as poignantly true today as 
when first penned. Any A. E. F. 
veteran, passing through the ghost- 
ly ruins of Ypres in 1918-19, might 
have stated the same fact in the 
same words with equal accuracy. 
And yet, after each war, stirred 
by invincible hope snd youthful de- 
termination, this city, although rav- 
ished by fire and sword, has in- 
variably risen from its ashes and 
its shell holes, staged a miraculous 
comeback, and restored itself to 
some semblance of its glorious past. 
The Ypres of 1938 is undeniable evi- 
dence of this historic truth. After 
each Calvary, Ypres has had its 
Easter morning. Doubtless the 
most marvelous resurrection of all 
was that which began in 1918. 
After much effort and sacrifice 
restoration is practically achieved, 
and this year, with understandable 


Priming for the race is under and after the Derby the sire of the pride, Ypres is celebrating. At the

as a day of rejoicing, thanksgiving 
and merriment. “Lift up your

comes the youthful and popular 
monarch, Leopold III, and the Earl 
of Athione, the uncie of King 
George VI of England.

TO ALASKA 


Nearly Half of It Built 
At Arctic End and in 
British Columbia 


By BERT STOLL 

Vancouves, B. C. 
GREAT international high- 
way, stretching through 
scenery of rugged grandeur 
in the hinterland of British 
Columbia, in Yukon Territory and 
deep into Alaska, will link the 
modern highway system of the 
United States with Fairbanks, just 
under the Arctic Circle. When 
that highway is put through, con- 
necting Seattle and Vancouver with 
Fairbanks, vacation-bent citizens 
motoring northward will get 

glimpses of new natural wonders. 

This motor route will be possible 
when the governments of the United 
State and of Canada forge the final 
links in the gigantic project. By the 
proposed route, through the interior 
of British Coiumbia, the Yukon and 
| Alaska, it is 2,250 miles from Se 
attle to Fairbanks. Of this distance 
| more than 1,000 miles of road, partly 
in British Columbia and partly in 
Alaska, are built and in use. 

The United States has already ap- 
| pengutnted more than $2,000,000 to 
| begin construction of its share of 
the long highway. An Alaskan 
Highway Commission is studying 
the project with representatives of 
the Dominion of Canada and of the 
Provincial Government of British 
Columbia.

BBE PERT GOL ER RE OE 
THE WORLD BOWS TO MAY DAY 


Traditional Spring Pageantry, Demonstrations by 
Labor and Many Speeches Mark the Occasion 


By HAROLD BUTCHER 

DAY is May Day round the 

world. The pageantry of tra- 

ditional ceremonies or the 
Marching feet of workers, or botp, 
will mark the day which, since the 
industrial revolution, is also Labor 
Day. Parades through the streets, 
fervent speeches, sometimes riots, 
have overshadowed the songs that 
greet the May morning and dancing 
Tound the Maypole. 

In England, which characteristic- 
uly combines ancient and modern, 
the tourist sees May 1 both as May 
Day and Labor Day. In the cool 
fawn he can join the crowd at the 
foot of Magdalen Tower in Oxford 
& 5 o'clock when the choirboys, 
shivering slightly, climb to the roof 
and sing the Latin hymn, ‘Te 
Deum Patrem Colimus,”’ written by 
& fellow of the College in the sev- 
‘teenth century. Then the bells 
ring out and over Magdalen Bridge 
come morris dancers, their heads 
@rlanded with flowers. 

London's Observance 

And then in a car to London to 
fee the labor processions to Hyde 
Park. On the way he may see chil- 
dren dancing round the Maypole, 
Wless, being Sunday, they postpone 
t. In many places the Maypole is 
ill erected. 

Lendon has its own May Queen 

val, no ionger around the great 
le which once stood in the 
4, but beautifully carried. out 
@ Hayes Common, near Bromley, 
the “home” county of Kent. The 
is always the first Saturday 
May Day. Similar ceremo- 
ere held at Knutsford, 10 

ire, and elsewhere. 
London these days the em- 
is placed on Labor Day ow- 
Ig to the active part which the 

Labor Party now takes in the af- 
Rirs of the nation, and the tense 

tional situation. Paris is 

Wt to get excited on Labor Day 

the tourist may find himself 
into a riot—something to 
home about! 
The Day in Germany 

te atrmany the day is now cele- 
ag the “Day of German 
tad » with giant parades, reviews 

Since 1933 labor 
have supplemented 
customs, but nowhere have 

N crowded them out. May Day 
© Bor y is still the beginning 

ng, the day for rejoicing. 
May Day customs signify 


the creative powers of nature. They 
go back for centuries and are still 
observed in cities, towns and vil- 
lages. Winter is definitely over, 
Spring has come. 

The May Queen and the May 
King are elected everywhere. The 
King calls for his Queen and brings 
her to the village green, or wher- 
ever the center of the celebration is, 
usually riding an animal, often a 
billy goat. Thousands of tourists 
seek out the billy goat festivals. 

Horse races, running and other 
sports have been part of the May 
Day celebrations in Germany for 
ages. Many districts, besides the 
general customs, have picturesque 
observances of their own. 

Italian Ceremonial 

In Italy the only festival held on 
May 1 is the Feast of San t’Efisio 
at Cagliari, Sardinia, in memory of 
the saint who is said to have saved 
Cagliari twice from great danger. 

As a contrast, the whole of the 
Soviet Union is turned over to a 
celebration of Labor Day on April 
30, May 1 and May 2—the first day 
to prepare, the second for proces- 
sions and demonstrations, the third 
for rest. The carnival spirit pre 
vails throughout Russia in a great 
national holiday. 

In Scandinavian countries—Swe- 
den, Norway, Denmark, Finland, 
Iceland—May Day is Labor Day, 
well-dressed prosperous men and 
women participating, not the sans 
culottes of the early days of labor 
demonstrations. Labor is strong in 
government of all these countries, 
and members of the government 
are among the speakers. In Swe- 
den there has been a vigorous effort 
to make May 1 a national holiday. 

No Labor Day demonstrations are 
permitted in Japan, but in China, 
in territories unoccupied by the 
Japanese, the workers are parading 
in protest agaist the invasion of 
their country.

Apple Blossom Fete 
In Ulster County 


Special to Tes Mew Youu Tuses. 
INGSTON, N. Y. — Ulster 


York State, home of the Mc- 
Intosh apple and center of the Hud- 
son Valley apple-growing industry, 
will hold its first Apple Blossom 
Festival next Friday to Sunday. 

As the result of a canvass mede 
in the county by more than 800 
committee members, aided by the 
Farm Bureau, Home Bureau, +H 
Clubs and members of the County 
Legion Auxiliary, it was announced 
last week that accommodations are 
available for thousands of visitors 
in households, hotels, inns and 
boarding houses. 

In this city end in every village 
and hamlet decorations are going 


up on pobate Cuviings, © wad, there will be an exhibition of early | grandfather and great-grandmoth- | 
including a er, John and Sarah Morris, when | 


houses and municipal buildings. The 
holiday epirit is in the air and many 
merchants, grumbling that after al! 
business is only business and the | 
festival will come only once a yesr, 
are planning at least a Friday wd 
Saturday closing to allow their em- | 
ployes and themselves to attend | 
whatever phase of the county-wide 
program appeals most. Perhaps the 
most exhilarating fact of all is that 
throughout the county’s three broad 
valleys, the Wallkill, the Rondout 
and the Esopus, miles of orchards 
are in full bloom, and the exquisite 
display will continue for three 
weeks or a month longer. 
co . o 

HUS all preparations for the 

celebration draw to a climax. 

For the better part of a year 
in homesteads, Grange halls, lodge 
and school rooms, artists’ studios, | 
church parlors and the committee | 
headquarters more than five thou- 
sand persons have given freely of 
their time and talents. Every one

ALUDA, N. C.—Who will keep | § 
the Morris fire going when & 
bachelor William Morris, 77, g 
years old, passes on? Wil- 
Ham Morris laid down his fiddle 
and looked at the bright fire. 
‘‘Well,”” he said, “I guess me and 
the fire will go out together.’’ 
Because neighbors are afraid that 
some morning they will rise and see 
no smoke curling from the Morris 
cabin, three miles from here, they 
have started a movement to have 
the National Park Service take over 
the fire and preserve it in the pro- 
jected museum in the Great Smoky 
National Park. 
The fire which burns so brightly 
on “Old Bill’s’’ mountain hearth 
was laid 147 years ago by his great-

in Venice, Firenze and a few other 
Italian towns, so Columbus was 
probably an Italian. 

However that may be, we saw a 
lot of the finest old Italian archi- 
tecture this morning, and also made 
a second pilgrimage to what we 
have always considered one of the 
most remarkable and fascinating 
places in the world—the Cemetery 
Campo Santo di Staglieno. Vast 
necropolis, many mile-long galleries 
with row upon row of magnificent-

absolute acme of the sculptor’s art.

Back to the hotel in a wheezingly 
decrepit taxi. Expensive, because 
gasoline soared up to around 90

sanctions and somehow the figure 
contrived to remain there. Our 


Jehu, pathetically glad to have al 


customer, told us in execrable 
French he hadn't had one for ten 
days! A quick lunch, substituting 
a very good omelet for all the mealy 
ravioli and spaghetti stuff, half a 
bottle of blood-red Chianti and off 
in the hotel bus to the Marnix to 
write these last few lines from Eu-

More than 137 inquiries, from 64 cities and

Lake Placid Chamber of Commerce advertised in 
The New York Times Resort and Travel Section. 

This announcement, which appeared on April 
10th, brought responses from as far South as 
Florida and as far West as California. Many 
inquiries were for definite information on hotel 
rates and cottage rentals.

GHO PLANS 
AIR DEFENSE 


Masses Planes and Men 
to Repulse Hypothetical 
Attacking Force 


ILITARY transports from 
the principal bases of the | 
United States Army Air 
Corps were shuttling in and 
out of Mitchel Field during. the, 
last week bringing supplies and | 
personnel for the manoeuvres 
which will concentrate on the pro-| 
tection of New England from a/| 
hypothetical enemy during the next 
two weeks. Planes came from sta- | 
tions as far west as March Field, | 


| Calif., unloaded their supplies and> 


returned for more. | 

At the field officers were hard | 
pressed with arrangements to ac- 
jcommodate several hundred extra | 
|planes, officers and enlisted men | 
|who were to compose the head-| 
‘quarters unit of the General Head- | 
‘quarters Air Force in command of | 
Major Gen. Frank Maxwell An-| 
drews. Many miles of special tele- | 
type wires were drawn to supple- 
ment radio direction of the defense 
against a coalition of ‘‘Asiatic and | 
European powers’’ assumed :to be | 
launching a fleet attack against | 
the United States. 

Planes Bring Supplies 


More than 2,300 men were trans- | 


Field, Mich.; Langley 
Field, Va., and other army bases 
to airports scattered throughout 
several Northeastern States for the 
military problem. 

The First Wing of the air force, 


Selfridge 


in command of Brig. Gen. Delos C. | 


Emmons, was scheduled to com- 
plete today the transfer of 1,091 
|}men from their permanent posts to 
the manoeuvre area. The Second 
|Wing, in command of Brig. Gen. 
Arnold N. Krogstad, had the job of 
transporting 600 men into the area. 

The Third Wing, in command of 
| Brig. Gen. F. L. Martin, was to 
bring 625 more. One of the prob- 
lems was the ability of the air 
force to move and support itself 
| far from its home bases. In addi- 
| tion to the transports, bombers and 
| other craft were used to expedite 
| the move. 

413 Ground Vehicles Used 
Tactical mobility was the meat of 
'the problem and 413 ground vehi- 
cles were pressed into service to 
expedite its solution. Twenty-one 
airports, many of them set up by 
municipalities throughout New 
England, were being used to base 
the air force. 

More than 300,000 gallons of gaso- 
line were cached at strategic sta- 
tions. More than 3,000,000 pounds 
of supplies were being transported

GERMAN AIRLINE WILL SPAN 
SOUTH AMERICA THIS MONTH 


By A. H. HAMMOND 
Lima. 

UFTHANSA of Germany has 
iP completed plans to begin dur- 
ing May a regular weekly air- 
‘plane mail and passenger service 
across South America from Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, to Lima, Peru. The 
flying distance of about 2,812 miles 
will be covered in a two-day flight, 
with ten to eleven hours flying 
each day. The fastest air time be- 
tween the two cities on Pan Ameri- 
can Airways via Buenos Aires is 

three and a half days. 
In connection with Lufthansa’s 


|South Atlantic service, mail time, 


between Lima and Berlin will be 
cut to five days. Passengers will be 
carried only between Lima and 


Natal, Brazil—i. e., the land section | 


of the through service. Passenger 
rates over this section have not yet 
been announced. 

In actual operation, the new line 
will employ three separate planes 
and crews. One plane will operate 
out of Rio de Janeiro to Corumba, 
another out of La Paz to Corumba 
and the third out of Lima to La 
Paz. The Rio de Janeiro plane will 
be operated by the Sindicato Con- 
dor, Lufthansa affiliate in Brazil; 
the La Paz plane by the Lloyd Aero 
Boliviano, Lufthansa affiliate in 
Bolivia, and the Lima plane by the 
newly formed ‘‘Lufthansa’’ (Sucur- 
sal del Peru).

In reply to a demand for lower | 


insurance rates on light planes, 
Jerome Lederer, chief engineer of 
Aero Insurance Underwriters, ad- 
vises pilots to ‘‘help keep insurance 
rates down by operating airplanes 
within their limitations.’’ In a bulle- 
tin om the subject of handling 
planes with a_wing-loading of 
around six pounds per square foot, 
Lederer advises pilots to stay on the 


ground when the wind gets up to} 


twenty miles an hour. 

If compelled to land in strong 
winds he advises novices to keep 
the tail high and, under certain cir- 
cumstances, to keep the tail up with 
an appropriate application of the 
throttle ‘‘until help arrives’’ to hold | 
the plane. Lederer might have

And Advertised for 
Export Abroad 


By JAMES BASSETT JR. 
Los ANGELES, 


O take advantage of the grow- 


ing export market, the Vul- 

tee aircraft division of the 

Aviation Manufacturing Cor- 
poration at Downey, Calif., last 
week embarked on a policy of 
heavy foreign advertising, expan- 
sion and redesigning of its single- 
engined attack-bomber which today 
flies in the service of China, Rus- 
sia, Brazil and several Near East- 
ern nations. 

Richard Palmer, chief engineer 
of the factory since the death of 
Gerard Vultee, pioneer designer of 
the all-metal fighting ship,- an- 
nounced that additional streamlin- 
ing of the bomber will increase its 
top speed to 260 miles an hour. 

With a backlog of less than 
| $2,000,000—smallest in more than 
three years—the Vultee firm will 
seek new foreign orders to aug- 
ment its present contract for 
twenty ships for Brazil. 

For this, Richard W. Millar, gen- 
|}eral manager of the reorganized 
Vultee unit, last week pushed plans 
for an export bomber capable of 
long-range missions. Basically, the 
1938 attack-bomber will resemble 
the civilian craft which carried 
Henry T. (Dick) Merrill on two 
round trips to England and Sigis 
j}mund Levanevsky, now lost in the 
|Arctic, across Alaska to Moscow 





| During the latter part of 1937 he |r, California 
was engaged in flying the Berlin-| : 
London night mail, which links the it 


As a medium-range craft, 
hirty-seven-foot monoplane with 
its fifty-foot wingspan is designed 
‘for a cruising speed of 245 miles an 
hour. With a cruising range of 
more than 1,300 miles, its service 
| ceiling is 23,000 feet. Fully loaded 
| to its 9,500 pounds capacity, it car- 
ries twenty thirty-pound bombs, 
|four fixed machine-guns and one 
| flexible gun. It has a three-man 
| crew. 

Fitted for long-range missions, 
the Vultee ship's speed is slightly 
slower—but its cruising range 
jumps to more than 2,400 miles and 
it weighs six tons. Armament in- 
cludes a°1,100-pound T. N. T. pro- 
jectile, two fixed and two flexible 
guns. Its power is a 1,000-horse- 
power Wright Cyclone. 

To add eight miles an hour to its 
speed, Engineer Palmer hag rede- 
signed a portion of the cowling, 
and has effected a fully retracta- 
ble tailwheel. In a compartment in 
the belly of the ship, which ‘“‘zips’’ 
open, an auxiliary machine-gunner 
can offer defense against attacks 
from below. This, too, has been 
fully streamlined. 

Eight hundred men work at the 
Downey plant when the Vultee 





can produce 125 ships annually— 
| $6,000,000 worth. Speed in building 
the craft has been assured by, the 
perfect spherical structure of the 
fuselage midsection, much of which 
lis stamped out on a sixty-inch 
drophammer.

and was flown by Captain Hans 
von Engel 5,200 miles non-stop to 
Caravellas, Brazil. 

Captain Engel'’s flight exceeded 
by 838 miles the world record held 
by Captain Marrio Stoppani, who 
flew 4,362 miles from Cadiz, Spain, 
to Caravellas. It exceeded the best 
American performance in the sca-| 
by 1,757 miles. The) 
American record was set by Lieut. | 
Comdr. Knefler McGinnis in a' 
flight from the Canal Zone to San, 
Francisco in 1935. He covered 3,443 
miles. 

The Italian and .American sea- 
planes used gasoline engines. 

The record-breaking German plane 
mounted in tandem two super- 
charged Diesels rated at 690 horse- 
power each. The plane was similar 
to the Aeolus and Zephir types first 
flown to the United States in 1936. 
The plane was designed for normal | 
cruising at 125 miles an hour and 
averaged 120 in the record flight.

(We Can), a Crafts and In- 
dustries Exhibition opens in 
this Norwegian capital on 
May 12 to continue throughout the | 
Summer. Although essentially local 
—in observance of the centenary of 
the founding of the Oslo Associa- 
tion for Handicraft and Industry— 
the event will reflect the compre- 
hensive picture of all Norwegian 
activity In the field it represents. 
The site for the exhibition will be 
on the winding shoreline of the Oslo 
fjord within the city proper, its en-

proudly to its progress in peaceful 
pursuits, to its buildings and the 
work going on in them rather than 
to any marching men in uniform. 

A new Town Hall of richly glow- | 
ing dark-red brick dominates the 
harbor. From the city side the twin 
towers have a monumental, austere 
simplicity, too tranquil to be de-| 
scribed as modern Gothic. In time) 
it may come to be called the Oslo 
style. From the water side these 
towers vaguely suggest the setback. 

A semi-circular wall of new struc- | 
tures in the same russet brick com- | 
bined with granite creates a spa-| 
cious Sun Place at the head of Uni-| 
versity Street.

American Minister, ‘‘than the ex- |

been developed. This industry has 
played a large part in the history 
of the country. It began in the 


olden days when the farmers wove | 


their own clothes, made their own 
furniture, household utensils and 
tools. 

“There is to me a touch of ro- 
mance in finding a loom in a 
home no matter how small. All the 
houses in Norway are scrupulously 
clean and most of them comfort- 
able. Members of a family gathered 


with her knitting or the beautiful 
drawn work peculiar to the Hard- 
anger district form a pretty pic- 
ture. 4

the new motor liner and flagship,

harbor. The interiors have been 
designed by some of Norway's lead-

illustrations will tell the story of

HE National Automobile Dealers | 


Association, at its convention 

in Detroit last week, put itself 
on record for a new set of rules to 
govern the relations of automobile 
merchants with each other, with 
the manufacturer and with the pub- 
lic. The thirty or more suggested 
rules of fair practice adopted by 
the conference under the auspiees 
of the Federal Trade Commission— 
which was a convention feature al- 
though not an official session—to 
serve as a basis for a code to be 
promulgated would go far, if ade- 
quately policed and enforced, to 
outlaw many of the evils which 
have been compigined of. It is of 
course only a framework and 
doubtless much modification will 
take place as a result of conference 
and the submission of briefs, before 
a code is actually promulgated. 
Meantime, cooler heads among the 
dealers look askance not so much 
at codes of fair practice as at a 
tendency which they seem to dis- 


cern of admitting the possibility | 
an- | 


and even, in some quarters, 
ticipating with pleasure regulatory 
legislation which might well—or as 
they feel very badiy—put the whole 
industry under 
merce Commission control. 


N order to determine the extent 

and seriousness of the parking 

problem on a national scale, a 
survey is about to be undertaken by 
the American Automobile Associa- 
tion. At a preliminary session of 
the parking committee, of which 
William A. Stinchcomb of Cleve- 
Jand is chairman, discussion was 
concerned largely with provisions

for off-street parking facilities and 
means with which to finance them. 
It was agreed that mere regulation 
of curb parking was not a sufficient 
answer to the problem, as in most 
communities there is not enough 
curb parking space to meet the de- 
mand. Typical key cities in various 


| classifications of population in dif- 


ferent sections of the country will 
be studied by the engineering staff 
of the AAA. . 

“It is quite apparent that many 
cities and villages are today facing 
traffic strangulation because of fail- 
ure on the part of authorities to 
deal aggressively with the parking 
problem,’’ Mr. Stinchcomb said. 
‘The purpose of our survey is to 
determine just how serious this 
problem has become; to gauge the 
amount of economic loss that has 
resulted and to determine the dol- 
lar-and-cents renefits that would ac- 
crue to business districts and to the 
community as a whole if present 
conditions are improved.” 

EVERAL encouraging factors 
were found last week in the

the Automotive-Aeronautics Trade 
Division, Department of Commerce. 


| He pointed out that exports were 


10 per cent better in the first quar- 
ter this year than in a like period 
of 1937; that they absorbed 24 per 
cent of the output, as against a 
norma! 11 per cent, and that do 
mestic new car stocks are lower 
than last August and used car 
stocks about normal. In these fac- 
tors Mr. Taylor sees solid ground 
for encouragement.

Flowers the Year Round 


With the idea of providing a floral 
| setting in every season, the land- 
scapers have set out a varied as- 
sortment of shrubs, including laurel, 
blueberry, sumac and beech plum, 
myrtle or bayberry, and vines such 
as honeysuckle and English ivy. 
Wild flowers decorate many slopes. 
One finds the black-eyed susan, 
| sweet william, columbine, lady-/| 
slipper, blood root, daisy and rag- 
wort. Grass covers the nakedness 
of cuts and fills made necessary in 
building the parkway. 

Like all other structures on the | 
parkway, the two new underpasses 
are of colonial ARand-made bricks. 


|}toured approximately four miles 


jand the National 





The aim throughout has been to| 
preserve the old-time atmosphere. 
While a modern concrete pavement 
had to be provided to accommodate 
the great volume of traffic expect- 


ed when the entire parkway is fin- | 


ished, the surface was specially 
treated to give the appearance of 
the gravel roads of colonial days.

This was done by brushing the top 
mortar with wire brooms and then 
washing the road with a muriatic 
acid solution that left the pebbles 
in the concrete exposed. 

The parkway is destined to con- 
nect Yorktown, Williamsburg and 
Jamestown, threading a region de-| 
scribed as the most historic area of 
ite size in the United States. At 
Jamestown the English founded 


| their first permanent settlement in 


America. 

For about three miles north of 
Yorktown the parkway runs along 
the bluffs of the York River, giv- 
ing magnificent views of the 
stream, said to have the deepest 
natural channel along the Atlantio 
coast, and a popular fishing and 
boating place. 

The parkway then swings in 
sweeping curves to near Williams- 
burg. Pending completion of the 
underpasses, traffic is being de 


east of Williamsburg into Route 60 
and thence into Williamsburg. 

The link from Williamsburg to 
Jamestown is in process of location, 
Park Service, 
which with the United States Bu- 
reau of Public Roads is developing 
the parkway, has announced no/| 





| date for its completion. 


When finally opened the parkway | 
will extend about eighteen miles. It | 
has a 500-foot right of way, the| 
pavement having three ten-foot | 
lanes of concrete with shoulders |

lipsburg, N. J., or along any rural 
highway. ‘ 

Furthermore, the price of gaso- 
line is directly affected by the pre- 
vailing marketing situation in any 
locality. Occasionally ‘‘price wars’”’ 
break out, usually caused by tax 
evasion or by the attempts of some 
service station to get @ larger share 
of the business by selling at prices 
which just cannot produce enough 
profit permanently to sustain the 
station, 

The consumer should know that 
80 many people are using gasoline 
today and gasoline is sold in so 
many places that the competition in 
the gasoline market is very keen, 
and consequently, prices tend to 
seek a lower level. However, this 
situation is seriously disturbed by 
taxation, and competition can have 
no effect whatever upon tax costs. 
It should be pointed out that when 
@ total of 16.7 cents is paid for 
gasoline in New York City only 11.7 
cents goes for the fuel. Taxes cost 
5 cents. In Weatchester the price 
may be 20 cents, but the gasoline 
costs only 15 cents. 

Tax Large Factor 

Just why gasoline should cost only 
about 12 cents in New York City 
and 15 cents in Westchester is bet- 
ter understood when it is realized | 
that rent is higher in Westchester, | 
and the price of a piece of land | 
there is often dearer than in some) 
sections of the metropolitan area. 

In Jersey City gasoline may sell | 
for 14.9 cents a gallon, of which 4) 
cents was tax and 10.9 cents for the! 
gasoline itself. The price in Pater-| 
son may be 13.9 cents, or 9.9 cents | 
for the fuel and 4 cents for tax. In| 
Phillipsburg the price may be 12.5| 
cents of which 8.5 cents was the 
actual price of the gasoline. 

In this connection I should like to 
point out that a ‘‘price war” has 
been going on for some time in New 
Jersey, and many dealers are being | 
forced sell at absurdly uneconomic | 
prices. It is impossible to a service | 
station, even in Phillipsburg, to| 
stay in business when it receives. 
only 8.5 cents a gallon for a com-| 
modity that costs nearly as much as 
that wholesale. 

Frankly, it is impossible defi-. 
nitely to say why these prices vary 
beyond making the general state-| 
ment that prices of gasoline accu- | 
rately and immediately reflect mar- | 
keting conditions. Many consumers , 
believe that the companies occa- 
sionally get together and ‘‘fix’’ gas- | 
oline prices, but, so far as I have. 
been able to ascertain, there is not) 
the slighest ground for belief that) 
any such event occurs. The ten-| 
dency is and has been to sell gaso- | 
line at the lowest ‘possible price | 
which will permit of maintenance | 
of a station. This is particularly | 
true because so much gasoline is) 
being made and must be moved and | 
sold at a market. 

I would ask you to recall that in 
the retail business there are many 
people who have many different 
ideas of the size of income they be- | 
lieve they should receive. Some) 
service stations can be operated at | 
a lower overhead than others and) 
can afford to sell their products) 
more cheaply. Others will just have |

water and the construction of pic 
nic grounds, would-be visitors are 
warned that they enter there at 
their own risk. 


Reasons for the Monument 


Although the prime object of set- 
ting aside such a large tract was 
'the preservation of the organ pipe 
| cactus, there were other considera- 
tions: the protection of the game, 
| particularly the Gaillard big horn 
sheep; the prevention of the remov- 





resort-in-the-making mood. Gaudy | if any men saw until the lake made | al of the rare cactus by unthinking 


cowboys and cowgirls of the dude 
variety stroll through, spurs clink- 
ing, and in a corner by the big fire- 
place a group of Nevada-divorce 
seekers may be chatting. 
and posted photographs tell of the 
area’s wonders and how they may 
be reached. Across the street is a 
government museum, where green- 
uniformed National Park Service 
men show exhibits of the region 
an¢ tell about the Boulder Dam 
Recreation Area—2,500 square miles 
of governmentally watched desert, 
canyons and lake, taking in the 
Colorado River from the Grand 
Canyon all the way to the dam and 
beyond. 

A theatre shows on the screen, 
daily, the building of the dam and 
Other things of visitor appeal. 

From Boulder City one rides six 
miles to the great concrete dam, 
which gave rise to this resort de- 
velopment. The car stops on the 
roadway atop the dam, and one 
looks up at canyon walls on each 
side, and at crazily perched electric 
transmission towers on their brinks, 
and wonders how that railway 
freight car being lowered by cable, 
from wires stretched across the 
canyon, down to one of the two 
power houses below the dam can 
look so small. 

By now, of course, one has 
glanced over the parapet down the 
sweeping face of the 727-foot dam, 
and perhaps has had his hat blown 
off by an uprush of air. One notes 
the power houses down there, one 
on each side, and watches for a 
moment the cascades of water, re- 
leased from pipes beyond them, 
that seem to gush from the can- 
yon’s red-brown sides. 


A Man-Made Lake 


Then one steps across the road- 
way and looks down at the im- 
prisoned waters—they can rise 
many feet more, though they have

The launch turns back and lands |

where in the old days prospectors

first by a desert road and then by 
a broad paved highway, back to the 
|dam and Boulder City, passing on 
| the way more shrubs than a desert 
|usually claims; cactus in great 
variety, sage, greasewood, mesquite, 
jand a forty-five-mile forest of 
Joshua trees lifting praying arms.

roadway atop the dam, and one 
looks up at canyon walls on each 
side, and at crazily perched electric 
transmission towers on their brinks, 
and wonders how that railway 
freight car being lowered by cable, 
from wires stretched across the

NEW 


Hungary’s Series Celebrating 


. . Congress—Other 


By KENT B. STILES 
GARY’S promised series 
to commemorate the 
“XXXIV Nemszetkési Eu- 
echarisstikus Kongresszus’’ 
(Thirty-fourth International Eu- 
charistic Congress), at Budapest 
from May 25 through 29, will bring 
two newcomers to philately’s gal- 
lery—Blessed Margaret, nun, and 
St. Maurice, monk and writer, both 
of whom were identified with early 
Christianity in the Magyar country. 
The set will contain likenesses also 
of four persons who have already 
been postally honored by Hungary: 
St. Stephen, or Stephen I (977-1038), 
on the 6filler denomination; his 
son Prince St. Emerich (1007-1031), 
on 10f; King St. Ladisiaus I (1040- 
1005), on 16f, and Queen St. Eliza- 
beth (1207-1231), on 32f. On the 
20f value will be illustrated the 
Holy Sacrament. 

A likeness of Margaret will be on 
the 50f. Daughter of King Béla IV. | 
She was born on Jan. 22, 1242, and | 
at the age of 4 she was given to the 
Daminican nuns, taking her vows | 
in 1254 in the Dominican cloister on | 
the Island of Hares, today’s St. 
Margaret Island in the Danube be- 
tween Buda and Pest. Rejecting 
luxuries which her royal parents 
sought to provide, she lived a life 
of poverty. She died on Jan. 18, 


Bishop St. Maurice or St. Mér, 
who will be honored on the 40f, was 
born at Nyitra, but records of the 
dates of his birth and death are not 
available, according to Dr. Laszlo 
Telkes, head of the Hungarian Ref- 
erence Library in New York. §8t.

art authorities in the Common- 
wealth have tatterly been sharply 
critical of the appearance of the 
postal paper there and have cited 
the United States National Parks 
series of 1934 as an example of 
what Australia should produce as 
a way to advertise the land and 
attract tourists to it. 

Apparently spurred by what the 
artists have been saying in the pub- 
lie prints, Australia’s Postmaster 
General has announced that six 
pictorials will be released ag soon 
as the designs have been selected. 
Each will present a scene in one 
of the six States—New South Wales, 
Queensland, Tasmania, South Aus- 
tralia, Western Australia and Vic- 
toria—which since 1913 have been 
using Commonwealth postal paper 
instead of individual stamps. It is 
planned ‘to have all six stamps re- 
leased at one time and the States 
are expected to be asked to make 
suggestions as to the vignettes. 

The artists’ censure is at, the mo- 
ment being directed at the four- 
pence stamp issued on Feb. 1, show- 
ing the figure of a koala, or Aus- 
tralian native bear, and the critics 
are saying that members of their 
fraternity should be invited to sub- 
mit designs when new postal paper 
is contemplated.

the first bridge club of its type to, 


which women were admitted as

the Cavendish Clute lost in 
popularity and Ely Culbertson 
founded Crockford'’s, on a more 
elaborate scale, in 1932. With its 
ewn restaurant and an entire pri- 
vate house, Crockford's was crowd- 
ed, attaining @ total membership of 
over six hundred. 

In 1986 a disagreement between 
Mr. Culbertson and Mrs. T. Charles 
Farrelly, who had been social direc 
ter of Crockford's, led to her leav- 
ing and organizing the Regency

the regular bridge games which 
bad been running at Crockford's,

An Accurate Assumption 


The average player long ago 
learned to distrust ‘‘cue bids'’— 
that is, bidding a sult simply to 
show the ace of that sult. With in- 
experienced partners, cue bidding 
jeads to many misunderatandings 
and the player is likely to find him- 
self at a contract at which he has 
no genuine trump suit. In the Van- 
derbilt Cup tournament and the 
masters’ individual tournament, 
completed last week, cue bids were 
much in evidence, however. 

Players who use cue bids for ace 
showing often bid on the assump- 
tion that if partner has not shown 
a certain ace, by bidding that suit, 
he cannot have the ace. This as- 
sumption kept Mrs. Raiph Young 
of Philadeiphia out of a losing 
grand siam in the masters’ indi 
viduat tournament, which Dr. R.H 
Ecker won from a field of thirty- 
six leading players.

fully told in hand-drawn and hand-illumi- 
nated art work .. . the painstaking creation 
of C, A. Paschke, who labored six years on 
this masterpiece. 

It is the kind of rare gem that righ 
belongs in a museum jackie ook

like it in the world. We cordially invi 
everyone to see this collection—but 
only a lover of art should buy it. Ww 
urnish the price on application only. 


This journey of homage will have 
philatelic interest because Rogers- 
Post memorial covers will be pre- 
pared for collectors. The expense

North's failure ever to bid clubs 
was accepted as proof of the fact 
that he could not hold either the 
ace or a blank club sult. There 
fore, South expected to lose a trick 
to the ace of clubs and stopped at 
@ contract of six. 

The six no-trump bid, rather than 
six spades, was a concession to the 
match-point scoring used in the in- 
dividual tournament. Six tricks at 
ho trump count 190 points, while 
six tricks at spades are only 180 
Points. With match-point scoring 
it is important to get every poss!- 
bie point, even a difference of ten 
points on a hand often affecting a 
player's position in the tournament. 

West made the excellent opening 
lead of the ace of clubs. Ordinarily 
it is a bad lead against a six no- 
trump contract, but West wisely 
foresaw that if he did not take his 
&ce at once South would be able to 
win thirteen tricks in spades, dia- 
monds and hearts.

committee of Crockford’s voted at 
ges last meeting, Tuesday afternoon, 
te dissolve the club, and the club- 
pouse, at 14 East Sixty-eecond 
girest, has been rented to the 
Cavendish Club, which will take 

ion immediately. 

The late Wilbur C. Whitehead 
founded the Cavendish Club fe 1838, 
the firet bridge club of its type to 
qbich women were admitted as 
members. After a few successful 

the Cavendish Club lost in 
larity and Ely Culbertson 
founded Crockford’s, on & more 
elaborate scale, in 1932. With its 
own restaurant and an entire pri- 
yate house, Crockford’s was crowd- 
ed, attaining a total membership of | 
over six hundred. 

In 1936 a disagreement between 
Mr. Culbertson and Mrs. T. Charles 
Farrelly, who had been social direc- 
ter of Crockford's, led to her leav- 
ing and organizing the Regency | 
Club, at 17 East Sixty-seventh | 
Street. The Regency Club quickly 
eaptured most of the players and 
the regular bridge games which | 
pad been running at Crockford’s, | 
end in the last two years Crock- 
ford’s membership has dropped te 
900 and Crockford's, Inc., the oper- | 
ating corporation, controlled by Mr. | 
Culbertson, has lost heavily.

An Accurate Assumption 


The average player long ago 
learned to distrust ‘‘cue bids’’— 
that is, bidding a suit simply te 
show the ace of that guilt. With in- 
experienced partners, cue bidding | 
leads to many misunderstandings | 
and the player is likely to find him- 


a 


to do so.

West dealt, with North-South vuk 
nerable. The bidding: 


If North had held « biddable suit | 
in diamonds, he would have bid | 


three diamonds over three clubs, in 


| order to show the suit at the low- | their defensive play. After taking | 


est possible level. His later bid of 
four diamonds was therefore read 
by South as an ace-showing bid. 
On the strength of this and of 
North's club support, shown when 
he bid five clubs over four no 
trump, South decided te bid the 
slam. 

The contract was made with ease.

Victory in the Vanderbilt Cup tour-

match-point scoring. The following | tablished, South won the remaining |

ace or a blank club suit. There- 
fore, South expected to lose a trick | 
to the ace of clubs and stopped at 
& contract of six. 

The six no-trump bid, rather than 
six spades, was a concession to the 
match-point scoring used in the in- 
dividual tournament. Six tricks at 
he trump count 190 points, while 
six tricks at spades are only 180 
points. With match-point scoring 
it is important to get every possi- 
ble point, even a difference of ten 
points on a hand often affecting a 
player's position in the tournament. 

West made the excellent opening | 
lead of the ace of clubs. Ordinarily | 
it is a bad lead against a six no- 
trump contract, but West wisely 
foresaw that if he did not take his 
ace at once South would be able to 
win thirteen tricks in spades, dia- 
Mmonds and hearts.

NEW STAMPS 


By LA RUE APPLEGATE 


EWS comes from Berlin 
that Adolf Hitler's birth- 
day, April 20, was com- 


memorated with a 12 plus 
38-pfennige semi-postal stamp, steel- 
engraved in sheets of fifty, with a 
picture of the Fuehrer adapted by 
Professor Richard Klein of Munich 
from a work by Heinrich Hofmann, 
the official photographer of the Na- 
tional Socialist party. The stamp 
was placed on sale at postoffices 
throughout the old Reich, but for 
technical reasons was not sold in 
Austria, although valid for postage 
there. The money derived from the 
surtax flows into Hitler's cultural 
fund.

BOY SCOUTS SET HEALTH GOALS 


ODAY is Child Health Day and 
President Roosevelt in pro- 
Claiming it called on all! chil- 
dren “to celebrate the gains they 
have made during the year in health 
and strength and to do their part 
the year-round effort to promote 
the health of the nation.” 


The Boy Scouts of America con- 
tiders the health and safety of its 
members of paramount tmportance 
and has a group of full-time lead- 
rs whose responsibilities are to 
Promote a better understanding of 

and safety standards and 
methods to be used in Scout camps 
and to be taught to Scouts. Local 

ang safety Boy Scout com- 
mittees share in the work. 


Boy Scout camps have excellent 
records because of the care- 

ful medical examinations given to 
all Scouts, leaders and food han- 


proper sanitation, careful program- 
making and good food. 

The health examination required 
of each Scout is designed to pro- 
tect him as well as his fellow-camp- 
ers. From a constructive health 
viewpoint these examinations dis- 
cover for the boy those physical de- 
fects which handicap him and 
which can be easily remedied in his 
youth. 

A four-page form developed by the 
movement contains a message 
the Scout's parents, a “‘why’’ mes- 
sage to the boy, & health history 
page for the parents to fill out and 
finally a page for the doctor's ex- 
amination.

AIR TRAVEL 


IN EUROPE | 


Planes’ New Luxury Facilities 


By HELEN DALLAS 
HE country club era of ailr-| 
plane travel in Europe has| 
arrived. Deck chairs, col- 
lapsible card tables, Scotch- | 
and-soda are all evidence of it. The 
time has passed when the majority 
of air travelers carry bulky brief-| 
cases and have urgent business to | 


| 
transact. Now many of them ee 


people who consider it a pleasure 
to go vacationing by plane. 


Owing possibly to America’s de-| 


velopment of Juxury air travel, Eu-| 


facilities. Chairs have been made 
more comfortable. Appetizing meals 
are served aloft (the dinner service 
between London and Paris makes 
that particular run the most popu- 
lar one on the Imperial Airways 
schedule). Magazines, books and 
games are provided. And in a few 
instances stewardesses—eelected for 
their charm and ability—have re- 
placed stewards. 

A few years after America inau- 





gurated the first transcontinental | 
sleeper planes, berths were built in ‘and there were little orange-bot-| Giovanni Martinelli, of the Metropoli- 


foreign ships. They have never 


her. “So you have been taking 
photographs with this,” he said, as 
he examined it. 

“Nothing of any importance,” she 
replied. ‘‘Just the airports where 
the plane stopped.”’ 

“Oh, that is all, is it? Just the 
airports,” he roared. ‘‘Don't you 
know they are military?”’ 

He snatched the films out of the 
case and took the “photograph ma- 


| chine” away. Before the plane left 


Sofia all passengers were given 
small cards that read, ‘‘Photo- 


‘ropean lines have adopted similar | graphieren ist verboten,” meaning 


that no camera pictures were to be 
taken. 

As we flew south from Sofia the 
country became rougher and more 
mountainous. Patches of snow ap- 
peared on the hilltops below us; 
ice began to form on the wings. 


| Broken-off chinks cracked against 


the window panes. The going was 
bumpy. In an hour or so we had

| been used regularty, however, since 
there are no scheduled night flights 
outside this country. In contrast to 
our planes, where no liquor is 
served, European airliners have 
built-in bars. One foreign nation 
has added still another convenience. 
In Berlin the German Government 
is building an airport at which 
planes will be able to land under 
leover. There will be no wet feet 
for passengers alighting there in 
stormy weather. 
Slower Cruising Rate 


Although many European ailir- 
planes have greater seating capacity 
than have our own, their cruising 
rate is slower. This is partly be- 
cause they do not travel ‘‘as the 
crow flies.'’ There are blind spots 
in their routes that must be avoid- 
ed. Pilots zigzag around fortifica- 
tions with the agility of mosquitos. 
Even so, although point-to-point 
flight takes longer than it does in 
this country, it is a great time- 
saver, considering the border offi- 
cials that are thereby avoided. 

This writer started on her first 
European air journey from Vienna. 
Her itinerary carried her south- 
east through Budapest and Athens 
to Alexandria and Cairo; west to 
Bengazi in Libya, and north again 
to Rome. As we left what was 
then Austria, and now is part of 
Germany, every seat on the plane 
was filled. There was even a Ger- 
man police dog aboard. As the 
plane soared upward, circled slowly 
and leveled off down the Danube 
passengers took out their guide- 
books to read about the country 
over which we were flying. 

Not a blue Danube this, but quite 
“blond,”’ as it rambled through 
the flat country below the plane. 
A German-made map called it 
“Donau.” It seemed very wide, 
slow and absorbed in its own busi- 
ness of supplying water to the 
grain lands that stretched as far 
as the eye could see to both sides 
of it. Boats plying between Vienna 
and Budapest were few and far be- 
tween. The plane passengers set- 
tled back at the windows and com- 
mented that the “trip would be 
tiresome, indeed, by train."’ 

Down at Budapest 

It was not long before the plane 
glided over a sudden crest of hills— 
came down over Budapest. There 
was a brief glimpse of bulbous 
buildings, of Eastern towers, and 
then, as the ship wheeled sharply 
onto the hard sgurface of the land- 
ing field, a white and chromium 
modernistic airport suddenly came 
into view. Porters in Hungarian 
costumes stood out strangely against 
the American-looking building. 

The trip from Budapest to Bel- 
grade and thence to Sofia was over 
rich delta land for the greater part 
of the way. Striped fields rotated 
out from peasant villages. The 
earth looked heavy and dark. As 
the plane approached Sofia bald 
spots of light-colored soil began to 


appear on the higher pieces of land. | 


One American passenger had been 
taking photographs throughout the 
journey, and although the airports 
at Belgrade and Sofia were not so 
impressive as that at Budapest, she 
took pictures of both of them. It 


|was at the latter city that the air- 


line official saw her camera.

him that I wasn't, but he didn’t be- 
|lieve it and that made him suys- 
|picious. ‘Pallas, Dellos, Dallos,”’ 
he said, ‘‘they are Greek names.”’ 

By Bus Into Athens 

The bus that took us to Athens 
chugged over the rocky, muddy 
road with great effort. Only when 
it entered the city did it show signs 
‘of life. From then on the horn 
blew continuously (as do all Greek 
horns) until the driver stopped be- 
fore the hotel. 

Just as Athens is the cross-roads 
of the air routes, the lobby of the 
Grande Bretagne (the hotel patron- 
| ized by air lines there) presented a 
| Cross-section of all the air passen- 
| gers in the world. There were citi- 
zens of London and Moscow, as 
well as of Addis Ababa and Bom- 
bay. They all had one thing in com- 
mon to talk about however—the fly- 
ing weather. And at the moment) 
they thought it bad. | 

The next morning at 4:30 passen- | 
gers bound in all directions were | 
aroused. It was a beautiful sunny | 
day. All planes would leave for all 
points. A fleet of buses and taxis 
made connections, and within two 
hours the last of the flying ships 
had left the Athens airport. | 

The Eastern express, on which I 
| was riding, circled slowly over the 
Acropolis, for the benefit of the 
passengers who had missed visiting 
it because of rain, and sailed out 
over the Mediterranean. | 





A Laxurious Interior 

The interior of the ship was 
luxurious. The seats stretched out | 
into lounge chairs. A steward pro-| 
vided steamer rugs. There were 
automatic dispensers of pills for air | 
sickness. The steward could be 
called upon to produce such items 
as eye-wash, a silent typewriter, | 
and a copy of an American maga- | 
| gine that was only two weeks old. | 

Passengers were introduced to 
each other by means of a printed 
|card on which the seats were num-_| 
bered, with the names and destina- | 
tions of the occupants typed in. Mr. | 
Rauwenhoff, for example, was go-| 
ing to Bankok; Mr. Ghosh, to Ka-| 
rachi, Mr. Baruah to Calcutta, and | 
Mrs. Weingarten to Jodhpur. } 

Arrival in Alexandria by plane 
was like dropping magically from 
the air into a new world. The ride. 
across the Mediterranean had pro- | 
vided no transition between the 


| Western civilization and that of the 
| East. 


Suddenly there appeared be-| 
fore us the flat white hot sands of |

“Oh, yes,” she answered. ‘It 
takes very good pictures.’’ 

He took the camera away from

JAMAICA PROJECT STARTED 


Flushing, Elmhurst, St. Albans 
and Forest Hills Are 
Active Centers 


Prospective home buyers in 
eons and adjacent parts of Long 
Island will have exceptional! oppor- 
tunities this week of inspecting the 


latest home types in all price ranges 
and also studying building .mprove 
ment methods and new equipment 
devices. The second annual Long 
Island National Home Show, whic! 
opened yesterday in the Jamaica 
Avenue armory, Jamaica, and wil! 
continue during this week, presents 
a wide variety of exhibits in struc- 
tural materials and the latest equip- 
ment devices for additional utility 
and convenience 

Developers and builders in many 
of the popular home communities 
confidently expect that the influ 
ence of the home show will arouse 
a keener interest in the advan- 
tages of home owning and prepara 
tions are being made to entertain a 
larger number of visitors than at 
any previous week this season. 

Prospective buyers will find in 
different localities comfortable 
homes ready for occupancy in all 
rice classes ranging from $4,000 to 

,000 and even more. Evidence 

of a substantial demand for dwell 
ings of the more expensive types is 
indicated in the announcement by 
David T. Wile Jr., manager of the 
Munsey Park community at Man- 
hasset, that four new homes rang- 
ing from $16,800 to $21,900 in price 
were completed last week 

Two of them were built by Abbey 
Homes, Inc., one being an English 
cottage type of eight rooms and 
three baths, fronting 111 feet on 
Abbey Road, while the other, also 
with eight rooms, is on the corner 
of Abbey and Whistler Roads. The 
other houses were built by John J 
Jerger and William H. Meyer on 
large plots. 


New Jamaica Community 


Henry Bernstein, builder, who 
has completed a group of homes in 
the Old Country Club Estates com- 
munity, at Twenty-ninth Avenue 
and 146th Street, Flushing, is pre 
paring to develop the tract which 
he recently acquired in the Jamaica 
Estates section of Jamaica. The 
property has frontages on Grand 
Central Parkway, Homeland and 
Kildare Avenues, Edgerton Place 
and Tryon Road, opposite the site 
of the campus for St. John's Uni 
versity. 

The tract is being subdivided into 
quarter-acre plots for the construc 
tion of homes ranging in cost from 
$7,000 to $12,000. They will conta: 
six, seven and eight rooms and are 
being designed by the architect 
Simeon Heller. The site provides 
space for the erection of about 
fifty homes and the initial group of 
tep dwellings is under construction 
They represent several architectural 
types. 

Jesberger Brothers, builders, have 


y 


twenty-eight dwellings under con- Sine 


struction at Joel Place and Hemp-

Mortgage Commission Speeds 
Work by 100% Revocation 
of Certificate Issues 





Substantial savings to investors, 
land the speeding up of mortgage 
reorganizations are being achieved 
by the State Mortgage Commission | 
under a new method of handling | 
| certificated issues in its care. The 
procedure, which is referred to as) 
“100 per cent revocation,”’ applies 
usually to small issues where loans 
have been made for about $10,000 
and where from five to ten holders 
are involved.

Spar Building, Says Dann 


The recent movement to have the 
large residential area north of Hill- 
side Avenue, between 150th and 
170th Street, Jamaica, changed 
from 8 small-home district into an 


| apartment house zone presages a

fice of the Bulkley & Horton Com- 
pany. 


Commenting on realty conditions |

iin this way, according to Thomas 
W. Christy, head of the Reorgan-| 
jizing and Servicing Department. 
Since the first of the year the plan 
has been used in 377 cases. At pres- 
ent about one-third of the 3,500 is- 
sues are suitable for this type of ac- 
tivity. Work has been started on 
about 1,100 issues. The reorganizers 
have reduced the costs by about 50 
| per cent-as compared with the long- 
jer method of promulgation and 
court actions. 


Procedure Explained 


| The procedure is to inform the 
| certificate holders by letter of the 
|two methods of reorganization. A 
trustee may be selected by the court, 
or by unanimous consent of the in- 
vestors. 

Representatives of the commis- 
sion get in touch with owners of 
| certificates in these issues and ex- 
plain the difference between the 
two types, with the result that in 
most cases the investors hold a 
meeting and decide unanimously to 
request the commission to revoke 
its agency in turning over the mort- 
gages or the property to a trustee 
selected by the group, which may 
be either an individual or an insti- 
tution. 

‘“‘An interesting development has 
been that in many cases where the 
borrower has found that holders 





| financing,’’ Mr. Christy said. 

| would be difficult to estimate just 
how much has been refinanced in 
this way, 

| considerable. 


“It must be remembered in pre jand fronting on both sides of 


senting this information, that this 
phase of our activity is in addition 
te the regular court reorganization 
work which is carried on by an- 


|of 100 per cent revocation we are 
| dealing with small mortgages. 
where the difficulties are less and 
the opportunities for refinancing 
greater than in larger issues. 
“While no definite rule can be 
made for the savings accomplished, 


a 100 per cent revoca- 
‘tion for a $20,000 mortgage held, 
we will say, by ten persons would 
about $138. The expense of re- 
ng this same mortgage by 
f promulgation and a court- 
appointed trustee would be about 
| $830. In this instance, the certifi-

conference with the Board

uce consumed in the Bronx has to 
be trucked into the borough from

@ Strathmore-at-Great Neck is the former Brokaw 
estate. It’s a picturesque, rolling piece of country 
on Long Island's famous North Shore. It has mag- 
nificent old trees overlooking the Sound. It has 
flowers and shrubs and a garden pool. It is high up 
—the place you'd expect a millionaire to live— 
and the views from its knolls and hills are some of 
the most picturesque in the Easfern United States. 


@ In such a setting homes are being built. Distinc- 
tive, charming homes—not just another bunch of 
houses. They're fine homes, built by an organiza- 
tion that has steadily built and sold more homes 
each year than the year before—and that includes 
the depression years, too. The materials and equip- 
ment are the finest that money can buy. 


@ The list of manufacturers reads like a page from 
Who's Who. Here they are: General Electric with 
its aif-conditioning equipment; Johns-Manville 
with a complete job of insalation; Anaconda with 
its red-brass piping; Electrolux with its de luxe 
refrigerators; Monel-Metal with its hot water 
systems; Magic Chef with its newest in gas ranges; 
Fenestra with its steel windows and bronze screens; 
Kohler of Kohler with its smart bathroom fixtures. 


@ But the unusual part of it all is that prices are 


standing come out today and see this outstanding value!

low—so low that as far as we can determine they 
are the greatest values since the depression of 1921, 
seventeen years ago. For instance, our lowest 
priced home is $8,990, and it can be bought with 


$1198 in cash. But price isn't everything. Here's 
what you get for $8,990: 


@ Six large rooms, breakfast alcove with built-in 
leather upholstered seats, attached garage, base- 
ment laundry, additional first-floor lavatory. You 
can get some idea of its size by two of its three 
bedrooms: they're each 17 feet long. The house is 
air-conditioned by General Electric, insulated by 
Johns-Manville, and the price includes refrigerator, 
screens, Venetian blinds, revolving clothes dryer, 


@ But that’s not all. The smallest plot of ground 
is about 75 by 100, bur most are much larger. And 
every plot is charmingly landscaped in the manner 
that has made every Strathmore community famous 
for its beauty. 


@ We'll take your order to build on the plot you 
select. It can be Georgian, Colonial, English, 
Regency, or Modern architecture, and you can 
have the pleasure of selecting your own decora- 
tions and details. You'll see sketches and plans, 
and if you're brave enough you can go thru a few 
houses under construction. 


@ But you'll have to hurry. We've got an unusual 
community, more-than-unusual homes, unbeliev- 
ably low prices—but there are not many plots lefe. 
The public is quick to sense value, so orders will 
have to be taken on a first-come-first-served basis. 


@ We suggest a visit to Strathmore-at-Great Neck 


at your earliest convenience—if possible, today, 
We're open every evening until nine o'clock.

trade associations, «porting con- 
cerns, real estate firms, nurseries | 
and the Federal Housing Adminis- | 
tration. The show is sponsored by | 
the Long Island Real Estate Board 
in cooperation with the FHA. | 

The largest exhibit is that of the) 
Brooklyn Union Gas Company, occu- | 
pying 3,120 square feet of space, on | 
which there is a forty-foot tower. | 
Here all the latest important de- | 
velopments and improvements in) 
the use of gas are demonstrated by 
the gas industry. 

Another exhibit, although not on 
the floor of the show, is tho model 
home, erected under the auspices 
of the Long Island Real Estate 
Board by Frank Droesch, builder, | 
from plans by Fred J. Burmeister, 
architect. It is at North Sixth 
Street, north of Jericho Turnpike, | 
in New Hyde Park, and has been 
open since March 20. 


Varied Home Exhibits 


Among the trade associations and 
groups exhibiting are the Associa- | 
tion of Licensed Plumbers, the oil- 
heating industry, the paint and 
varnish industry and the wallpaper 
industry. | 

On the floor the Queensboro Cor- 
poration has erected a full-sized 
model apartment of four and one-| 
half rooms which is an exact repro- 
duction of an apartment in Berkeley 
Gardens, one of the corporation's 
projects. 


Surrounding exhibits on the floor rooms, three baths, maid’s room with bath, workroom and sun terrace over the garage. In the basement is 
a laundry with space for a recreation room. Walter Grant Thomas of this city is the architect and Chris 


ig an immense garden, laid out by 
Hicks's Nursery of Westbury, which 
is demonstrating a series of plant- 
ing and landscaping plans for mod- 
erate-priced homes. The nursery 
has introduced for the first time a 
collection of new and unfamiliar‘ 
shrubs and flowers that have been 
developed especially for small 
grounds. 

The island's sports and recrea- 
tional facilities are being demon- 
strated by A. G. Spalding & Bros. 
In addition, several Long Island 
golf club professionals are demon- 
strating the finer points of golf. 

At the FHA's exhibit many fa- 
mous American homes are displayed 
on the pylons. Among them are: 
the White House, Monticello, home 
of Thomas Jefferson; Mount Ver- 
non, home of George Washington,

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 

At the Brooklyn Union Gas Com- 
pany'’s exhibit there are demon- 
strated the various types of gas 
house-heating and _ refrigerating

ers. The appliances of the Ameri- 
can Gas Products Company, Bryant

display. 

Another feature is a cooking

FUEL ECONOMIES 


Insulation and Other Devices 
Reducing Coal Consumption 


Economies effected by architects, 
builders, building materials manu- 
facturers and heating and ventilat- 
ing engineers have cut down the 
consumption of coal by home own- 
ers, according to a recent report of 
the Nationa! Bituminous Coal Com- 
mission. 

Among the factors contributing to 
this situation, states the report, are 
improvements in house insulation, 
automatic heat controls, advances 
in burner constructions, more effi- 
cient radiation and the increase 
use being made of competitive fuel 
and other forms of energy, par- 
ticularly oil, natural gas and hydro- 
electric power. 

In regard to insulation, engineers 
estimate that fuel savings of from 
15 to 40 per cent may be secured, 
depending upon the type of dwell- 
ing, age and condition of the struc- 
ture and amount of insulation 
applied. 

Of the insulating materials in cur- 
rent use, mineral wool, because of 
its efficiency and the ease with 
which it may be applied, either in 
strip, bat, nodulated or granulated 
form, is found most effective. 


ENLARGING ROOM SPACE 


Recessed Radiators Will Provide 
Additional Facilities 

When additional wall space is 
needed for furniture, recessed ra- 
diators help to solve the problem. 
When so placed, tables or low desks 
or chairs may be arranged in front 
of the grilles without interfering 
with the heating of the room. 

In addition, the radiator need not 
be placed under a window when it 
is receased, and the actual size of 
the radiator may be cut down be- 
cause the draft created by the wa!! 
stacks in which the radiator is set 
carries the heat away from the ra- 
diator faster and spreads the 
warmed air more evenly about the 
reom,

PROPER WAY TO BUILD 
EFFICIENT FIREPLACE 


Method Senseted to Prevent| 
Smoking Troubles 


Officials of the FHA offer the fol- | 
lowing suggestions for the con- 
struction of a satisfactory non-| 
smoking fireplace: 

Determine the size of the opening | 
desired and then select a flue lin- 
ing that has an area equal to one- 
tenth of that opening. Use prefera- 
bly a round flue. Build the fire 
place with a depth of between 
eighteen and twenty-four inches, be- 
cause more than that depth robs it | 
of a good deal of its heating effi- 
ciency. 

Install a cast-iron damper for the 
full width of the opening. This 
should be set so that the curving 
back of the fireplace makes a con- 
tinuous line with the back of the 
damper opening. Above the damper, 
at the back, flush with the top 
edge of the opening, build a hori- 
zontal smoke shelf about eight 
inches deep and for the full width 
of the opening. 

Also above the damper build a 
smoke chamber, with the front ris- 
ing as a continuation of the front 
piece of the damper opening and 
the back rising perpendicular to 
the smoke shelf. The sides should 
slope up at an angle of 60 degrees. 
This chamber must be symmetrical, 
and the first tile of the flue lining 
must start at its apex, directly over 
the center of the fireplace. 

The first tile must be perpendicu- 
lar, but succeeding tiles may be set 
on an angle, if necessary, but 
should not exceed 45 degrees from 
the vertical. The fireplace flue must 
be independent of other flues and 
the top of the chimney should be at 
least two feet above the highest 
| ridge.

| CAVITY WALL USES 


One Benefit Is Protection From | 


Moisture, Says M. L. Matthews 


Cavity brick walls, used exten- 
sively in Europe, are becoming in- 
creasingly popular in this country, 
according to Myron L. Matthews, 
writing in the Dow Service Daily 
Building reports. 


This is due, he points out, to the placed in grooves in the plate and | ¥84 selected 


fact that they are claimed to pro- 


a vide 100 per cent protection against a completely 


rain and other outside moisture and 
also to afford a high degree of heat 
insulation because of the dead air 
space. 
| Technically, he says, a cavity wall 
is a load-bearing masonry wall con- 
sisting of two sections at least one 


brick thick, separating by an air) 


space of not less than two inches

SMALL HOME BUILT. 
IN WORKING DAY 





Prefabricated House Erected 
in 81, Hours in New | 
Jersey Community | 


' 

A demonstration of the rapidity 
with which a home can be con- 
structed by means of the Tim-Bo- 
Lok prefabrication method was pre- 
sented last week in Bergenfield, 
N. J., on a tract on Vreeland Ave- 
nue near Prospect Street under de- | 
the Model Homes 
Builders, Inc., headed by Elmer 
Blomkvest. 

The foundation of the house 
which has no cellar, had previously 
been laid but the actual construc- 
tion of the house from the founda- 
tion to the completion of the roof 
was finished within eight and one- 
half hours. 

The prefabricated system, ex- 
plained Mr. Blomkvest, represents 
the development of a method pat- 
ented by Harold and Raymond My- 
ers, the controlling officials of the 
Tim-Bo-Lok Corporation of Haw- 
thorne, N. J. The first house of 
that type was built and sold in 1935 
and since that time careful experi- 
mentation has perfected the build- 
ing methods. 

Several houses of that type have 
been erected on the government 
airport at Elmira, N. Y., and a 
group of similar homes has been 
erected at Hershey, Pa., for the 
workers in the Hershey chocolate 
factory. During the past year, it is 
stated, fabricated parts for these 
houses have been shippod from 
Hawthorne to many localities in 
Florida. The corporation reports | 
eo about 400 houses have been 

uilt. 


Methods of Building 


This system of prefabrication | 
utilizes 4by-8inch cedar timbers, | 
which are interlocked on all sides 
to each other and to corner posts, | 
window and door frames, forming | 
|a solid wall. Roof rafters are de- 
jlivered cut, notched and fitted for | 
/plate and ridge: The gable and/| 
timbers are cut to the exact length | 
jand pitch of the roof and are! 
|rafters. When erected the house is | 
interlocked timber 
building from sill to ridge, calcu- 
jlated to withstand the severest 
|weather. The builders claim that 
jeconomies of standardization and 
large-scale production are obtained 
without sacrificing individuality of 
| design. 

A wide variety of exteriors and) 
floor plans are provided for in-

DUPLEXES FEATURED 
BY CIRCULAR ROOMS 


Suites Replacing Field Home 
Have Unasaal Design 


Circular rooms designed to insure 
against obsolescence are being pro- 
vided in the two buildings which 
are replacing the former home of 
Marshall! Field at 3 East Sixty-ninth 
Street and 4 East Seventieth Street. 
Builders usually shun such rooms 
and all but straight connecting 
stairways in duplex suites because 
of the expense involved in such con- 
struction. 

On the former Field property, 
however, Sylvan Bien, architect, has 
laid out luxurious duplexes of two, 
four, five or six rooms. One build- 
ing contains thirty-three apart- 
ments and the other thirty-eight. 

The most unusual apartment is a 
two-room duplex with a circular 
foyer, living room, powder room) 
and kitchen on the lower floor, with | 
an attractive winding stairway lead- 
ing to the upper floor, which has a 
bedroom, dressing room, bath and 
spacious closets. 

The lobbies of the buildings have 
eight murals of contemporary New 
York scenes conceived and exe- 
cuted by Pierre Bourdelle. The 
mural subjects include ice skating 
at Rockefeller Center, Trinity 
Church and the Central Park Zoo. 

The buildings are owned by Wat- 
ford Estates, Inc., and are being 
erected by the Wheeler Engineer- 
ing Company. “he lobbies, in mod- 
ern Regency style, are being fur- 
nished by Myers, Minnot Co. 
Many of the »partments have been 
leased, according to Brown, Whee- 
lock, Harris, Stevens, Inc., renting 
agents.

| Many Evidences of Progress 
| Throughout the Country 


Encouraging reports of improve- 


|; ment in the real estate market 
| throughout 


the country supple 
mented by increasing loans by sav- 


i 
|| ings and loan associations for new 


|home construction were presented 
to the Federal Home Loan Bank 
| Board by the presidents of the 
various Federal loan banks at their 
recent semi-annual conference in 


| 
| 
| 
| 


| Washington, ~ 


| George L. Bliss, president of the 
Federal Loan Bank of New York 
| called attention to large savings 
| deposits into the thrift and home 
|financing institutions which are 
members of his bank district. 
These funds, he said, have placed 
the associations in the New York 
area in a position to retire or 
greatly curtail their borrowings. 
Fully 50 per cent of the current 
‘oans being made in his district, he 
jadded, were for new construction, 
| thereby creating a real stimulus to 
business and employment. 

“Many of the institutions in the 
New York district,’’ Mr. Bliss 
stated, have strengthened their po- 
sition and improved the public's 
confidence in them by insuring 
their share accounts up to $5,000 
for each investor with the Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Cor- 
poration, a governmental agency 
having a capital fund of $113,000,- 
000. “There is a growing apprecia- 
tion on the part of the public of 
the value of such insurance.’ 

Mr. Bliss also announced that 
membership in his bank district in- 
creased by twelve home financing 
institutions during the year. 


Activity in Southern States 


One of the most heartening re- 
ports was made by O. K. LaRoque, 
| president of the Fourth District 
Bank in Winston-Salem, N.C. He 
said that both rentals and sales of 
homes were showing a strong up- 
ward trend. From 60 to 75 per cent 
of the lending associations in the 
Southeastern States is for new con- 
struction, he added, and member- 
ship in his bank district increased 
by twenty-five institutions during 
the past year.

Ninth District Bank in Little Rock, 
Ark., reported a growing demand

Bill Allowing Use of Funds

Commercial and industrial real

which stresses income as a better 
basis for taxes than assessments. 

The attorneys have prepared on 
the subject a paper which they 
hope will arouse interest in favor 
of an equitable method of taxation 
of real estate comparable to the 
systems of taxing other forms of 
property. 

Estimating taxes now imposed on 
properties in this city at 30 to 30 
per cent of their gross income, the 
attorneys declare that this means 
in the vast majority of cases a net 
return of practically nothing, or at 
best, a fraction of 1 per cent. 

As an example of the precarious 
position of real estate ownership 
when taxes begin to pile up, the at- 
torneys cited the case of the owner 
of three parcels on which there was

Before these developments, he 
said. many firms were handicapped 
by their inability to obtain banking 
assistance despite the fact that they 
were active concerns, because plants 
and equipmert are not regarded 
by banks as adequate security for. 
loans as they are not within the

Mr. Honig pointed out that ac | 
cording to Jesse H. Jones, chair | 
man of the RFC, it is not the in- | 
tention to compete with banks but 
to do everything possible to restrict 
RFC lending to that type of credit 
risk which banks were unwilling to | 
assume. The objective of the RFC, 
therefore, is to make loans that | 
will enable manufgcturers to carry | 
inventories, to replace machinery | 
and to create jobs. 

“This decision,’’ he added, “is of | 
tremendous importance to every) 
one concerned with real estate own- 
ership and operation because ex-, 
panding business means a demand | 
for more space. More employment | 
means, also, enlarged purchasing | 
power which, in turn, is reflected | 
in improved retail store rental con- | 
ditions.”’ |

“Business men,’’ explained Mr. 
Honig, ‘‘thus were faced with the 
necessity for borrowing from pri- 
vate interests, which is costly, or 


closed in 1935, the mortgagee has 
as yet received no income, while 
the taxes imposed ($2,300) are more 
than 331/3 per cent of the gross 
income. There have been no bid- 
ders for the property, according to 
the attorneys, who said they had 
been informed that the owner 
would sell for $40,000, or one-half 
of the amount invested. 

Another example was cited in 
which the same owner had to take 
over at foreclosure a parcel, the 
gross rent of which is now only 
$900 and the annual taxes upon 
which at present are $1,300. 

Urging savings banks, insurance 
companies, owners and managers 
of real estate and building contrac- 
tors to unite in a movement to 
abolish the present system of taxa- 
tion and work for a plan based on 
the gross income of property, the 
attorneys suggest that the tax 
based on income could be collected 
monthly and would be a lien upon 
the rentals. 

“To avoid the situation of taxes 
representing an enormous propor- 
tion of the gross income, some con- 
stitutional limitation upon the rate 
of tax upon such income would 


in the 
State Constitution as to the rate of

was quiet during the Fall and Win-

active, with a good outlook for the 
Spring and Summer.” He said 
twelve new savings and loan asso- 
ciations with assets of $25,000,000 
had joined his bank during the last 
year 

In the New England States, re- 
ported W. H. Neaves, president of 
the First District Bank in Boston, 
better lending plans and low inter- 
est rates are attracting an increas- 
ing number of home buyers. Mem- 
bership of his bank, he said, in-

C. A. Sterling, president of the

stated that through 1937 the sale 
and construction of homes in- 
creased, but the market has ‘‘defi- 
|nitely slowed up within the last

new members during the year. 
| R. J. Richardson, president of the

the Bronx Joint Committee have re-| 
newed their’ campaign for early 
action on construction of the Bronx 
easterly approach to the Triborough 
Bridge, states Roderick Stephens, 
president of the board and chair- 
man of the committee. 

Letters have been sent, Mr. Ste 
phens said, to Mayor La Guardia 
and the other members of the Board 
of Estimate and to Park Commis | 
sioner Robert Moses in an ogee] 
to ascertain the present status of 
the proposed highway. At tMe same 


\it is definitely a business, except | time a meeting of the joint commit- 


tee has been called for tomorrow 
evening at the Board of Trade of- 
fices, 349 East 149th Street, to map 
a campaign of action. 

In making the announcement Mr. | 
Stephens declared that Governor | 
Lehman's veto of the six parkway 
appropriation measures, including 
the Dunnigan bill, makes it impera- 
tive that the city act promptly on 
the easterly approach. Such action 
is necessary, he pointed out, to in- 
sure its completion in time for the 
opening of the World’s Fair. 

The nnigan bill called for the 
appropriation of $1,050,000 to extend 
the Hutchinson River Parkway in 
the Bronx from Goose Creek in Pel- 
ham Bay Park to the Bronx and 
Pelham Parkways to connect with 
the new Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, 
now under construction. 

In the letters Mr. Stephens pointed 
out that the bridge highway project 
is considered by both the board 
and the committee as an essential 
part of both the Triborough and | 
Bronx-Whitestone projects, as well 
as being essential to the city-wide 
arterial highway system and the 
Bronx. 

The committee is composed of 
representatives of more than thirty | 
Bronx civic and taxpayer groups) 
formed for the purpose of obtaining | 
action on the project.
