SAN FRANCISCO, April 30— 
The United Nations invited Argen- 
tina to attend the San Francisco 
Security Conference today despite 
sharp and repeated requests by| 
Russia that Argentina be omitted 
until the Polish Government in 
Warsaw is invited. 

The delegates brought White 
Russia and the Ukraine into the 
conference without a dissenting 
vote, but the Russian Foreign 
Commissar, Vyacheslaff M. Molo- 
toff, fought the Argentine invita- 
tion in the executive committee, 
carried the fight to the steering 
committee and then, defeated in 
both places, appealed to the press 
and to the full plenary session of 
the conference, which finally re-

When asked how much inter- 
est they had in the conference, 
while they sat in the Opera 
House just before today’s ses- 
sion began, they had comment 
such as this: 

“We're interested. We want 
to see peace. We had a big 
stake in this war. We want to 
see what comes out of this war.” 

The Navy asked wounded 
men at Mare Island whether 
they wanted to view the confer- 
ence in action. More said “yes” 
than could be taken today.

Fifth, Eighth Armies Push 
North—French Ad- 
vance in West 


By VIRGINIA LEE WARREN 


By Wireless to Tae New Yorx TimEs. 

ADVANCED ALLIED HEAD- 
QUARTERS, Italy, April 30—The 
German armies in Italy have been 
“virtually eliminated,” Gen. Mark 
W. Clark, the Allies’ ground com- 
mander, said today. 

Turin, thirty miles from the 
French border and the last great 
city north of the Po River, is in the 
Allies’ and the Partisans’ hands to- 
night. At the opposite end of the 
battle line, units of the British 
Eighth Army have driven within 
seventy-five miles of Trieste. 

The hopelessness of the German 
isituation was summed up today 
when General Clark said: “The 
military power of Germany in Italy 
has practically ceased, even though 
scattered fighting may continue.” 
‘Pointing out that this destruction 
had been accomplished since the 
offensive began on April 9, he said: 
“Twenty-five German divisions, 
some of the best in the German 
Army, have been torn to pieces and 
can no longer resist} our armies; 
housands of vehicles, tremendous 
quantities of arms and equipment 
and over 120,000 prisoners have 
been corralled.”

Baltic Port Seized 


By The Associated Press. 

LONDON, Tuesday, May 1—Red 
Army troops, storming the blazing 
administrative heart of Berlin, 
captured the gutted shell of the 
German Reichstag yesterday, run- 
ning up the Russian victory flag 
over the Nazi monument in a 
sweep that threatened to split the 
last defenders of the German cap- 
ital. 

The fall of all Berlin appeared 
imminent. The Russians stepped up 
their struggle for the city to un- 
precedented proportions in a pos- 
sible bid to win the entire city to~ 
day while Moscow celebrates May 
Day. 

Soviet troops were within a mile 
of tearing the capital into two iso- 
lated pockets, each less than nine 
square miles. They had won the 
Ministry of the Interior, near the 
Reichstag; were laying siege to 
Hitler’s underground fortress in the 
Tiergarten, were at Berlin's tri- 
umphal arch, the Brandenburg 
Gate, and were across the Spree 
River from Berlin's cathedral. 

Stalin Issues May Day Order 

German broadcasts admitted that 
the ten-day battle for the devas- 
tated capital was as good as lost, 
while Premier Stalin, in a May Day 
order of the day, said that the war 
|was approaching its end and de 
clared: “The last assault is on.” 

Marshal Stalin said that 1,800,- 
000 Germans had been killed of 
captured during the last three te 
four months of fighting on the 
eastern front. His announcement 
meant that 11,540,000 German cas- 
ualties had been inflicted by the 
Red Army in less than four years 
of war. 

As 9,000 more German troops 
surrendered in Berlin, raising to 
65,500 the toll of enemy dead and 
captured in four days, north of the 
dying capital Red Army troops, 
rolling out mile-an-hour gains 
across Mecklenburg Province, 
seized the Baltic port of Greifs 
wald and smashed within forty- 


inviting Argentina were Russia, 
Czechoslovekia, 
Greece. 


Third, discussions on naming the 
heads of the working commissions 
and committees of the conference] 
continued amid authoritative re- 
ports that Mr. Molotoff would turn 
over discussion of the Dumbarton} 
Oaks proposals to Andrei A. Grom-| 
yko, Soviet Ambassador to Wash- 
ington, and leave for Moscow early 
next week, if not before. 

Anthony Eden, British Foreign | 
Secretary, is expected to leave soon | 
after Mr. Molotoff. Despite these| 
indications, Secretary of State | 
Stettinius expressed confidence 

hat the conference would con- 
tinue without interruption, this to! 
hold also in the case of the end of | 


the war in Europe. | 
Molotoff Skill Praised 
Today was one of sharp and| 
cogent argument by the Russians 
on fundamental issues, and it is 
only fair to report that, while 
there was general opposition among 
the delegates to the Russian argu- 
ment in favor of the Warsaw 
Poles, there was more than a little 
support for argument against Ar- 
gentina and considerable admira-) 
tion for the skill and persistence | 
with which Mr. Molotoff put his}

WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
Government tonight cut sugar ra- 
tions by 25 per cent. The an- 
nouncement was made by the Of- 
fice of War Information, which 
said sugar reserves in the United 
States are at “rock bottom.” 

OWI, which spoke for the Office 
of Price Administration and the 
War Food Administration, said 
that Sugar Stamp 36, good for five 
pounds, which becomes valid to- 
morrow, would be stretched over a 
four-month period instead of three, 


jand that no additional stamp would 


be validated before Sept. 1. 

In addition, local OPA boards 
were instructed to issue only up 
to 70 per cent as much sugar for 
home canning as they issued last 
year and to limit amounts per in- 


the 160 pounds announced earlier 
in the year, the agency said. 

Sugar allotments for hotels, 
schools, restaurants and other in- 
stitutional users also were re- 
duced, and OPA indicated that still 
further cuts were in prospect on 
July 1 for industrial users. 

The reasons for the reduction, 
OWI said, were a heavy decline in 
supplies, greatly increased require- 
ments for liberated Europe and a 
rate of civilian consumption far in 
excess of allocations. 

“Consumers this year for the 
first time in two decades must de- 
pend entirely on current produc- 
tion,” OWI declared. 

The agency’s report stated that 
tentative allotments proved too 
great in view of a drop in produ:- 


dividual to fifteen pounds, com-/tion and a rise in the military de-| 
pared with last year’s maximum of | mand. |

may come tomorrow.” There was 
visual evidence on all sides as 
the disintegrating fronts failed 
to stand anywhere against final 
Allied thrusts. Count Bernadotte 
was reported to have Himmler’s 
acceptance of the Big Three’s 
ultimatum [1:6-7], and Stock- 
holm heard that the Germans 
were negotiating a withdrawal 
from Denmark under supervision 
of a Swedish commission. [1:7.] 

Two Soviet armies were clean- 
ing up Berlin, the fall of which 
was imminent. The Reichstag 
building, which when it burned 
enabled Hitler to dramatize his 
hatred of Communists, was cap- 
tured and the Russian flag was 
raised on the ruins. Moravska 
Ostrava and Zilina in Czechoslo- 
vakia were taken. To the north 
the Red Army compressed the 
Baltic pocket and drove closer 
to the British Second Army, 
along the Elbe River. [1:8, maps 
Pages 6 and 4.] 

The United States Seventh 
Army captured Munich and was 
thirteen miles from Innsbruck. 
Germany’s southern redoubt was 
being torn into several segments, 
with the United States Third 
Army moving on Salzburg and 
Berchtesgaden and the French 
First Army crossing into Aus- 
tria and entering Vorarlberg. 
The ‘United States Ninth Army 
joined the Red Army northeast 
of Dessau, and the First Army 
made a second contact near Wit- 
tenberg. [1:4; map P. 4.] 
General Clark declared that 
| the German Army no longer 
existed as a military force in 
Italy. American troops entered 
Turin, thirty miles from France, 
after the city had been liberated 


villa on Lake Garda was taken 
by Americans. Yugoslav Parti- 
sans have nearly captured 
Trieste. [1:3; map P. 4.] This 
brought an Italian demand that 
the Allies put out Marshal Tito 
and return the city to Italy. [3:8.] 

The notorious Nazi extermina- 
tion camp at Dachau was cap- 
tured by the Seventh Army fol- 
lowing a furious battle and 32,000 
prisoners freed. [1:6-7.] Ameri- 
can and British officials were 
amazed by an accusation of the 
head of the Soviet Repatriation 
Committee that liberated Rus- 
sians were not “always being 
treated as citizens of an Allied 
State.” [5:1.] 

Acting Secretary of State 
Grew said the United States did 
not recognize a provisional Aus- 
trian Government, announce- 
ment of which had come from 
Moscow. Britain’s attitude is 
similar. [8:1.] 

Machinato airfield on Okinawa 
has been torn from the stubborn 
Japanese defenders. [1:5.] Amer- 
icans on Mindanao advanced ten 
miles from Digos to seventeen 
miles south of Davao, Talikud

tured by guerrillas. [10:6.] 

Foreign Commissar Molotoff 
was voted down in the executive 
committee and steering commit- 
tee and at a plenary session of 
the San Francisco Conference 
when he opposed admission of 
Argentina, White Russia and the 
Ukraine were seated without op- 
position. [1:1.] Mr. Molotoff

been characterized as fascist by 
American officials, should not be

cluded. [14:2-3.]

weapons dropped by slain guards, 
acted swiftly on their own to exact 
full revenge from their tormentors. 

The sorting of the liberated pria- 
oners was still under way today 
but the Americans learned from 
camp officials that some of the 
more important captives had been 
transferred recently to a new hide- 
out, probably in the Tyrol. These 
were said to have included Pre- 
mier Stalin’s son, Jacob, who was 
captured in 1941; the former Aus- 
trian Chancellor, Kurt Schusch-

cated that the force would prob- 
ably be composed of a proportion 
of planes over here now and would 
consist of current types unless the 
occupation force stayed here so 
long that these types became ob- 
solete. 

“Tf we are over here a hundred 
years we will have to develop some 
new types of planes,” General 
Spaatz said laughingly. The size 
of the occupational air force would 
be that “adequate to perform the 
task it has to do,” he added. 


Enemy positions southeast of 
Hamburg and near Lauenburg, and 
road and rail transport between 
Lauenburg and. Ludwigslust and 
east of Schwerin, were attacked 
by fighter-bombers and _ rocket- 
firing fighters Thirteen enemy 
nircraft were shot down over our 
Elbe bridgehead 

In Czechoslovakia our forces cap- 
tured an airfield one mile northeast 
of Eger (Cheb) which was strongly 
defended by 1,000 enemy troops. 
Three hundred and fifty prisoners 
were taken. . 

Northeast of Straubing, in Ger- 
many, our troops captured Lam. 
Southeast of Regensburg our ar- 
mor captured Plattling, entered 
Haader and advanced eight miles 
southeast of the town. Our infan- 
try elements cleared Straubing and 
reached the vicinity of Fierlibrunn, 
Other units captured Malmersdorf, 
entered Schatzhofen and reached 
the vicinity of Moosburg. At 
Moosburg a prisoner of war camp 

of 27,000 British and American 
| troops was liberated. 
| Farther west our infantry reached 
| the vicinity of Hirschbach, twenty- 
| two miles north of Munich. Our 

forces captured and cleared the 
| concentration camp near Dachau. 

Approximately 32,000 persons were 
| liberated. Three hundred SS guards 

at the camp were quickly over- 

come, 

Our armor entered the outskirts 
of Munich. 

We reached the northern end of 
the Ammer See. Armored spear- 
heads swung around its southern 
tip and pushed five miles north- 
ward along the eastern shore to 
Herrsching. To the south other 
armor reached Spartzenhausen. We 
captured Saulgrub and drove south- 
ward into the Bavarian Alps to 
Oberammergau. 

South of Fussen we expanded our 
hold in Austria and advanced to 
the vicinity of Rosschlag. 

In the area north of the eastern 
end of Lake Constance our units 
pushed southeast along a front of 
nearly twenty-five miles. Advances 
of up to fifteen miles brought our 
forces to Leutkirch and eingar- 
ten. 

From the Munich area to the 
Iifer Canal we took 35,890 prison- 
ers, and between the Iller Canal 
and the Rhine 3,500, including two 
generals. 

Allied forces in the west captured 
74,986 prisoners on April 28. 

Several large road convoys, main- 
ly moving southward in the area 
east and south of Pilsen, and a 
large number of rail cars, many of 
them loaded with motor transport 
in the area, were attacked by 
fighter-bombers. Throughout the 
day more than 900 road vehicles 
and rail cara were destroyed or 
damaged.

LONDON, April 30 (AP)—A German 
jcommuniquée, as broadcast from 
Hamburg and recorded by The Asso- 
ciated Press: 

The heroic fighting for the center 
of the Reich capital continues with 
unabated violence. In bitter street 
and house-to-house fighting troops 
of the Wehrmacht, Hitler Youth 
and Volkssturm are holding the 
heart of the city. At the Anhalter 
station, along Potsdamerstrasse 
and in Schoeneberg, where the 
Russians have broken in, they were 
checked by the gallant defenders. 
Air formations, in self-sacrificing 
deployment, again dropped ammu- 
nition over the town. 

South of Berlin German divisions 
which have been thrown in to re- 
lieve the capital are engaged in 
heavy fighting with the enemy at- 
tacking deep into the German 
flanks. The Russians were repulsed 
with heavy losses. 

Between Berlin and the Baltic 
Sea the front line has veen closed

The First Regiment of French 
chasseurs parachutists, command- 
ed by Lieut. Col. J. M, A. Fauer, 
now forms a tactical part of the 
First Allied Airborne Army under 
the command of Lieut. Gen. Lewis 
H. Brereton, it was announced 
Monday. Members are veterans of 
the Colmar pocket in January, 1945, 
and the Belgium Bulge in Decem- 
ber. 

The chasseurs were originally or- 
ganized in 1937 and, as one com- 
pany, participated as Commandos in 
the French resistance in the Alsace 
area. Disbanded during the armis- 
tice with Germany, it was reformed 
in North Africa and trained ai the 
United States Airborne Training 
Center in Oujda, and by Sept. 5, 
1944, was again fighting on French 
soil, taking part in the Vosges cam- 
paign and capturing the towns of 
Broce, Menil and Tavorxin.

FIFTEENTH ARMY 
HEADQUARTERS, Italy, 
(UP)—An announcement 
Mark W. Clark: 


Troops of the Fifteenth Army 
Group have so smashed German 
armies in Italy that they have been 
virtually eliminated as a military 
force. This destruction has all been 
accomplished in an offensive which 
is now twenty-two days old for the 
Eighth Army and fifteen daye old 
for the major part of the Fifth 
Army. 

Twenty-five German divisions, 
some of the best in Germany, have 
been torn to pieces and can no 
longer effectively resist ow armies. 
Thousands of vehicles and tre- 
mendous quantities of arms and 
ee and over 120,000 prison- 
ers have been captured and many 
more are being corraled. 

The military power of Germany 
in Italy has practically ceased, 
even though scattered fighting may 
continue as remnants of German 
armies are mopped up.

Twentieth Air Force announcement: 

A two-pronged strike in very great 
strength was made by the Twenty- 
first Bomber Command today, April 
29 Eastern War Time (April 30 Jap- 
anese time) against two Japanese 
homeland islands. 

While one force of B-29’s under 
Maj. Gen. Curtis E. LeMay con- 
tinued the attack on air installa- 
tions on Kyushu Island, another 
struck at industrial targets in the 
Tokyo area. 

Further details will be announced 
at headquarters of the Twentieth 
Air Force in Washington after the 
bombers return to their bases in the 
Marianas Islands. 


WASHINGTON, April 3% 


B-29’s of the Twentieth Air Force 
yesterday, April 29 Eastern War 
time (April 30 Japanese time) at- 
tacked concurrently the two major 
Japanese homeland islands. 

While one force of Superfortresses 
from the Twenty-first Bomber Com- 
mand under aj. Gen. Curtis E. 
LeMay bombed the Tachikawa 
army air depot on the outskirts of 
Tokyo and industrial targets at 
Hamamatsu, south of Tokyo, both 
on Honshu Island, another force 
maintained the daily assault upon 
air installations on the southern 
island of Kyushu, A very large 
task force carried out the two-way 
blow and all planes returned safely. 

The Tachikawa and Hamamatsu 
attacks were made by instrument 
and results were not observed. Ene- 
my air opposition and flak were 
weak, 

On Kyushu the Superfortresses 
bombed bases at Kanoya, Kanoya 
East, Kokubu, Iota, Tomitaka and 
Saeki. It was the fifth strike in five 
days by the Twenty-first Bomber 
Command upon the _ important 
southern Japanese air bases and re- 
sults were described as good. Ene- 
my fighter opposition ranged from 
none to heavy over the six targets 
and anti-aircraft fire ranged from 
none to moderate. 

Final tabulation of claims made 
by Superfortress crews in the April 
28 (April 29, Japanese time) attacks 
on Kyushu air bases shows that 
thirty-six enemy planes were de- 
stroyed and thirteen others prob- 
ably destroyed

Early in the morning our troops 
broke the Germans’ resistance 
Developing their swift offensive, 
Soviet units advanced thirty kilo- 
meters and occupied the town and 
port of Greifswald, strong point of 
German defenses and important 
junction of communications. 
Other Soviet units fought battles 
on the approaches to the town of 
Neustrelitz. The enemy had trans- 
ferred tanks and motorized infan- 
try to this area and by asatrong 
counter-attacks attempted to halt 
our troops in forests east of the 
town, The Germans set up road 
blocks and mined all roads. Soviet 
tommy-gunners, mortar crews and 
artillerymen dislodged the Hit- 
lerites from the wooded hills and 
broke into the town of Neustrelitz 
from the south and southeast. By 


| this time our sappers had cleared 


the road for our tanks. By a com- 
bined blow of infantry and tanks 
the enemy was driven out of Neus- 
trelitz. In battles in this area up to 
2,000 German officers and men were 
wiped out. 

Our airmen in the course of air 
combats during the day brought 
down twenty-two planes and an en- 
emy balloon. In addition to this, 
seven German planes were de- 
stroyed on one of the airdromes. 

Troops of the First White Rus- 
sian Front continued to fight bat- 
tles in the streets of Berlin. The 
enemy gripped in a vise in the 
central districts of the town, is 
putting up stubborn resistance. The 
Hitlerites are keeping up a strong 
fire directed at crossroads and 
buildings, thus killing the civilian 
population 

Our units, which yesterday cap- 
tured the town district of Moabit, 
crossed the River Spree in the east- 
ern part of Tiergarten Park and oc- 
cupied the building housing the 
Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ger- 
mans launched a desperate attempt 
to restore the situation. 

Our infantrymen, in hand-to-hand 
fighting, routed the enemy and 
reached the Zelten Allee and then 
began to storm the buidling of the 
German Reichstag from the west. 
At the same time, our units which 
had reached the Reichstagufer Em- 
bankment, broke into the Reichstag 
from the north. Unabated battles 
lasted the whole night. Today So- 
viet men took possession of the 
building of the German Reichstag 
and hoisted the banner of victory 


| on it. 


Southeast of Berlin an encircled 
group of German troops launched 
yet another attempt to break 
through the steei ring of Soviet 
troops. Enemy infantry went into 
the attack in columns. Soviet artil- 
lerymen and machine gunners pelt- 
ed the Germans with a hail of fire. 
Aiming at solid columns of Hitler- 
ites, our machine-gunners inflicted 
very heavy losses on the enemy 
One of our formations alone wiped 
out over 5,000 German officers and 
men. An enormous number of guns, 
mortars, machine guns, motor vehi- 
cles and a great quantity of other 
military equipment was captured. 

Troops of the Fourth Ukrainian 
Front carried by assault the town 
of Moravska Ostrava. The enemy 
was stubbornly defending the ap- 
proaches to the town, an important 
stronghold of German defenses and 
a large industrial center which sup- 
plied the German Army with arms, 
ammunition and military equip- 
ment. 

On the approaches to Moravska 
Ostrava the Germans created a de- 
fense zone up to thirty kilometers 
in depth. Three defense lines, con- 
sisting of trenches, firing points 
and armored emplacements for ar- 
tillery and machine guns, anti-tank 
pits and wide-stretching minefields, 
covered the town from three sides. 

Soviet units, overcoming the en- 
emy’s defense, advanced persis- 
tently and cut the roads leading 
from Moravska Ostrava to the west 
and southwest. Developing their 
success, our troops crossed the 
River Odra and, as the result of a 
skillfully executed assault, today 
captured the town. Many prisoners 


| and much booty were captured. |

Warships of the 
Baltic Fleet in the southern part of 
the Baltic Sea sank an enemy sup- 
ply ship of 6,000 tons. Aircraft of 
the Fleet Air Arm sank a German 
submarine 


now along a Ine through Neustre- 
| litz, Neubrandenburg and Anklam 

In northwestern Germany al! en- 
emy ‘attempts to enlarge the 
bridgehead near Leer failed with 
high losses. Also, northwest of 
Oldenvurg and west of Delmen- 
horst, all British attacks were re- 
pulsed. Southeast of Hamburg the 
British threw further units into 
| the battle. Their attempts to push 
in the direction of Luebeck from 
their Lauenburg bridgehead were 
frustrated. i 

In lower Bavaria, between the 
Iser and the Danube; the enemy 
gained further ground to the south. 
Other American forces are stand- 
ing north of Landshut as weil as 
between Freisim and Dachau. In 
upper Swabia Augsburg and Kem- 
pen were lost. 

Heavy fighting is raging for the 
entry into the mountain passes on 
both sides of Lake Garda, north- 
west of Verona and south of Bres- 
cia, The garrison of Fiume is 
putting up a heroic defence against 
attacks from land and sea. 

In the southern sector of the 
eastern front the situation has he- 
come more consolidated. In the 
area around Bruenn the Russians 
stopped their attacks owing to their 
heavy losses, Northwest of Morav- 
ska Ostrava, enemy break-through

ROME, April 30 (®)}—The Italian 
Government demanded tonight that 
Trieste and all Venezia Giulia 
Province, ceded to Italy after 
World War I and now being occu- 
pied by Marshal ‘Tito’s Yugoslav 
troops, be governed by Allied 
military authorities “under terms 
of the armistice.” 

Premier Ivanoe Bonomi con- 
ferred with Allied leaders on 
| whether the Yugoslavs should be 
permitted to occupy the territory 
|}at the head of the Adriatic Sea. 
Trieste, an important port, has 
been a bone of contention between 
the two countries for years 

An Italian Government state 
ment said a solution to the contro- 
| versy could not be reached until 
Italy and Yugoslavia had govern- 
ments chosen by a’ majority of 
their peoples. 

: The Government’s assertion that 
rrounded by Partisans as he is led from the popular court in| the disputed area “must be en- 
trusted in accordance with terms 
of the armistice to Allied adminis- 
tration, as has been the case with 
the rest of Italian territory” did 
not make clear whether the armi- 
stice specifically mentioned Vene- 
zia Giulia. A substantial portion of 
the armistice terms has never been 
made public.

Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine 
said yesterday in reply to a 


written question from newspa-

He said that the air-raid 
sirens here would not be turned 
on to signal the end of Euro- 
pean hostilities. The commis- 
sioner said also he had received 
no instructions from military 
authorities concerning V-E Day 
procedure. 

Bars and grills and other 
liquor dispensing establishments 
will neither be requested nor or- 
dered to close, the commissioner 
said, adding that he “did not be-

United Press reported.] 

Tonight Mussolini’s body lay in 
a half-open white wooden coffin 
Milan. Next to it, in another 
crude coffin was the body of his 
mistress; scattered throughout the 
room were dozens of bodies of men 
executed by the Partisans. They 
were labeled “unknown.” 

Graziani, who was also captured 
by the Partisans in northern Italy, 
was reported to have gone on trial 
this morning a few hours after the 
bodies of Mussolini and his follow- 
ers had been removed from the 
Piazza Quindici Martiri, where 
they had been displayed publicly 
since Saturday night. At head- 
quarters of the Committee of Na- 
tional Liberation it was said un- 
officially that Graziani had been 
convicted and quickly executed.

NOTE—From time to time, in this space, 

there will appear an article which we hope 

ull be of interest to our fellow Americans. 

This is number ninety-two of a series. 


SCHENLEY DISTILLERS CORP., NEW YORK 


““Quotes” 


“American tanks and guns and | 


jeeps are in action all over the world 
because yeasts made alcohol from 
sugar, and chemists made this fer- 


mentation alcoho! into butadiene, | 


and this into synthetic rubber. It 
is true that in this great crisis in 
motorization and mechanization it 
was the zymotechnologist (fermen- 
tation chemist) that made rubber 
supplies possible and reasonably 
adequate.” 

We have quoted Dr. R. E. Buchanan 
of lowa State College from his re- 
cent article in “‘Science’’, the organ 
of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science. 


Dr. Buchanan further states: 
“Right now millions of bushels of 
grain are being converted into 
rubber. To what extent may agri- 
culture look to fermentation indus- 
tries in the future, to assist in 
relieving us of great surpluses of 
grains, surpluses which are abso- 
lutely inevitable without major 
changes in world economy, changes 
which at the best can be brought 
about but slowly?” 


We at Schenley, together with all 
distillers, ceased producing alco- 
holic beverages on October 8, 1942. 
With the exception of two months, 
August 1944, and January 1945, 
our distilling facilities have been 
devoted “around the clock” to the 
production of alcohol for war pur- 


poses. Much of this alcohol is used | 


in the manufacture of butadiene, 


essential in the production of syn- | 


thetic rubber, to which Dr. Bue 
chanan refers 


And for a better understanding of 
our business, may we remind you 
that much of the grain we use in 
making alcohol for war, or bever- 
age spirits in peace time, returns to 
the farms from whence it came. 
Only the starch in the grain is con- 
verted into fermentable sugar by 
malt, and then into alcohol, by 
yeast. The rest of the grain values, 
the proteins and minerals, etc., 
are recovered, and made into poul- 
try and cattle feed. This feed is 
needed on the farm to make eggs, 
dairy produce and meat. 


We were very much interested too, 
in what Dr. Buchanan said in the 
conclusion of his scientific article: 
“We are on the verge of new ad- 
vances which may have the most 
far-reaching consequences to stand- 
ards of living and to civilization’’.

of U. S. and Soviet Forces 


By HAROLD DENNY 


By Wireless to Tus New Yorx Times. 

AT A RED ARMY HEAD- 
|QUARTERS in Germany, April 30 
—The commanders of the Ameri- 
can and Soviet field armies that 
joined their front south of Berlin 
last week met for the first time to- 
\day in an official celebration of 
|that historic event. 

Gen. Courtney H. Hodges, com- 
|mander of the United States First 
|Army, journeyed east of the Elbe 
and called on Col. Gen. Alexei 
Zhadoff, commander of the Soviet 
Union’s Fifth Guards Army, 
bringing him the congratulations 
and good wishes_of the First Army 
and receiving in return the com- 
radely felicitations of the Russians 
who had fought their way from the 
ruins of Stalingrad to meet the 
Americans in the heart of Ger- 
many. 

General Hodges brought the red 
and white standard of the First 
Army, which had been carried up 
jthe Normandy beach across France 
and Belgium and on to the. Elbe 
and presented it to General Zha- 
doff and his army. In return Gen- 
eral Zhadoff presented a Stalin- 
grad Medal to General Hodges as 
the Red Army’s tribute to our 
|First Army and its leader. 


Drink to Unity in Peace 


There were exchanges of toasts 
iby the two generals with warm 
mention of Premier Stalin and the 
late President Roosevelt and Presi- 
dent Truman and expressions of 
hope that the friendship celebrated 
|here today between the triumphant 
jarmies of the two great countries 
| would long endure as a guarantee 
of peace. 

| That was the formal, official 
|part of the ceremony. There ac- 
}companied it a demonstration of 
|Russian hospitality so elaborate, 
|so complete and so whole-hearted 
jthat it seemed incredible that it 
|was virtually in a front-line set- 
|ting and in the midst of war. 

General Hodges, accompanied by 
jhigh officers of his staff, was met 
|at the Elbe by the commander of a 
| Russian corps in line on this front 
jand conducted to the Army com- 
|mander at a chateau a short dis- 
ltance from the river. The Red 
|Army had prepared welcome signs 
lon red bunting and lined way with 
lthe Soviet flags and the Stars and 
\Stripes and the Union Jack. Rus- 
jsian girl military police signaled 
|the party with red and yellow 
| flags. 

Fluttering red banners made the 
\lawn in front of the ch&teau look 
llike the Red Square in miniature 
lon May Day. A Red Army band 
iplayed “The Star-Spangled Ban- 
Iner” and the Soviet anthem as 
|Genera! Zhadoff greeted General 
| Hodges in a portico. Then every- 
body went in and presently were 
|seated in a large hall converted 
into a banqueting room. 

Thes Russians spread a banquet 
\for the Americans that could 
|match the best that the Soviet 
Foreign Office used to give in Mos- 
|cow in peacetime. It began with 
lan elaborate Russian zakuski— 
|whole fish and fowl, roast pigs, 
|plates of ham and sausage and 





|smoked salmon, pickels of many 
|sorts, radishes, green onions and 
bowls of salad with torrents of 
vodka, cognac and champagne to 
| wash it down. It was another one 
of those bottoms-up affairs, with 
casualties on both sides. We 
thought the zakuski were the 
whole meal, but after that came 
|a thick, rich “shchi” for the soup 
course and then roast mutton and 
\fruit salad after that. A toast 
|of the generals punctuated this 
|and between times while they ate, 
|Generals Hodges and Zhadoff 
| talked earnestly of military mat- 
ters. 

The whole incredible afternoon 
ended with a wild flurry of Cos- 
sack dancing down the space be- 
tween the tables. 





NINTH’S JUNCTION DULL 


Link-Up Marred When Russian 
Mine Kills 2 Americans 


By FREDERICK GRAHAM 
By Wireless to Tux New Yore Times. 

APOLLENSDORF, Germany, 
April 30—American soldiers met 

Russian troops in this tiny agri- 

cultural village southeast of Wit- 
tenberg at 1:30 P. M. today and 
thereby widened the military cor- 
ridor that bisects Germany into 
north and south areas of resistance. 

Historically the event may prove 
to be of great importance. Ac- 
tually it was a dull affair. it was 
jutterly anti-climactic and there 
{was no mistaking the feeling that 
|both the Russian and American 
|soldiers felt the same ~y about 
it. The attitudes of the fighting 
}men of both sides can be summed 
jup in these words: “So what.” 

To a correspondent who had 
spent two days and a night witn 
jan American spearhead trying to 
|make contact with our Russian a:- 
jlies, our meeting in Apollensdorf 
|was more than anti-climactic—it 
was tragic. I have seen more 
drama on a Seventh Avenue sub- 
way at 5:30 P. M. And infinitely 
more action and excitement. 

The final and actual linkup of 
the Americans and Russians on the 
outskirts of Apollensdorf was 
|marred by the fact that two Amer- 
icans were killed and another seri- 
|ously injured by a mine placed in 
the road by the Russians. 

At the outskirts of the town two 
American jeeps finally convinced 
the Russians, who had been in 
Apollensdorf for four days just sit- 
ting and waiting, they were really 
Americans and started toward the 
town. The first jeep drove safely 
down the dirt road but the second 
wound up a mass of twisted metal 
and two of the three occupants 
were killed when the mine planted 
by the Russians exploded. 

A Russian noncom, who was 
about the equivalent of our own 
|T/5, dug up with his bayonet what 
looked like our Revolutionary War 
|type of mine, made full apology 
;and expressed remorse at not hav- 
|ing warned us that his forces had 
| planted the explosive charge. Lieut. 
Charles G. Barrett of Montana, 
and leader of the first cavalry 
platoon to enter Apollensdorf, was 
the first American to grip the 
|hand of a Russian on the Ninth 
Army front,

TTH WINS MUNICH 
PUSHES INTO ALPS 


Continued From Page 1 


Elbe, augmented by a new crossing 
by the United States Eighty-sec- 
ond Airborne Division, has made 
solid progress, with British patrols 
pushing ten miles out of their 
bridgehead over the Elbe. 

By far the most important sec- 
tors on the front are those on the 
south and in the north, where the 
strongest of Hitler’s redoubts are 
slowly crumbling unde® a succes- 
sion of heavy assaults. 

yen. George S. Patton's Third 
United States Army, on the left 


flank in the south, now has ele- | 


ments of two armored and one in- 
fantry division over the Isar River 
and is driving southeastward to- 


'ward Salzburg and Berchtesgaden. 


The French First Army, on the 
western or fight flank of the re- 
doubt front, is moving into the 
Austrian Tyrol down the valley of 
the Ill River. 

With the entry of Americans into 
the national redoubt and the solid 
gains by the British Second Army 
into the heart of the northern 
pocket, the final phase of the 
operations set in motion by last 
Friday’s link-up with the Red Army 
has begun. The Russian forces 
are racing eastward across the 
Prussian plain toward the left 
flank of the United States Ninth 
Army around Wittenberge on the 
Elbe, southeast of Hamburg, and 
probabl will form another pocket 
east of Berlin. 

The entrance of the Highty- 
second Airborne Division into the 
battle in the north and the in- 
creased weight and speed of the 
operations in the south all point 
to an intensification of the opera- 
tions against the redoubts, perhaps 
the last two major operations that 
the western Allies will fight. 

The advances into the heart of 
the Austrian Tyrol by the Seventh 
Army’s Forty-fourth and 104d In- 
fantry Divisions and the Tenth Ar- 


mored Division are taking place | 


south and southeast of Fuessen, a 
mile north of the Austrian frontier. 

The most important tactical pen- 
etration was made by a column of 
the 103d Division. The doughboys 
smashed down across the frontier 
to reach Mittenwald, thirteen miles 
northwest of Innsbruck, which lies 
at the northern end of the Bren- 
ner Pass into Italy. 

The troops “ollowed a road that 
leads straight south into the Inn 
Valley and joins the main lateral 
road behind the outer defenses of 
the redoubt five miles west of 
Innsbruck, 

No serious opposition has been 
encountered, which substantiates 
the belief that the speed of General 
Patch’s advance has_ brought

| defenders could reach it even 
southwestern Czechoslovakia and | 
northern Italy. 

Other units of the 103d Division | 
are clearing *he rough country east 
of Fuessen,. 

The Forty-fourth Infantry Divi- 
sion pushed into the redoubt down 
the Valley of the Lech, reaching 
Wissenbach, eight miles south of 
Fuessen. Other units of the Forty-| 
fourth Infantry and Tenth Armored | 
Divisions made twelve miles to 
reach Lermoos, five miles south 
of the frontier and fourteen miles 
southeast of Fuessen. 

Other units of the Tenth 
Armored Division thrust south 
from Oberammergau and captured 
Garmiisch-Partenkirchen, scene of 
the Winter Olympic Games early 
in 1936. 


Patton Expects Battle 





The enemy is assembling ar-}| 
mored formations in this area, 
probably for a counter-attack that 
he hopes will avert temporarily at 
least General Patton’s threat to 
the communications of the German 
armies in eastern Austria and the 
danger to the supply lines running 
out of Czechoslovakia through 
Linz to Salzburg and the eastern 
sector of the redoubt. 

Some such enemy reaction has 
been expected for some days now 
and General Patton has strength- 
ened not only his forces along the 
Austrian frontier but those on the 
extreme left flank along. the} 
Czechoslovak border. [Press serv- 
ices reported, however, that Third 
Army units moved deeper into 
Czechoslovakia in the Eger area! 
Monday. |] 

The Eleventh Armored Division, 
which hag halted its drive into) 
Austria, at least temporarily, set 
some units to work clearing the 
area west of the frontier. Tanks 
entered villages ten miles east of 
Passau north of the Danube and 
pushed as far as Hutthurm, five 
miles northeast of Passau. 

Elements of the Twenty-sixth| 
Infantry Division continued to 
drive down the east bank of the 
Danube, making five miles on an 
eight-mile front to points a few 
miles northeast, north of Passau. 

Elements of the Thirteenth and 
Fourteenth Armored Divisions and 
the Eighty-sixth Infantry Division 
are now over the Isar along twen- 
ty-two miles of its course. 

Tanks of the Thirteenth swept 
over the river at two points. One 
column crossed at Plattling, just 
south of Deggendorf and advanced 
two miles south, southeast of the 
river. Another column crossed fif- 
teen miles southwest of Plattling 
in the vicinity of Mamming. 

Meanwhile, elements of the 
Fourteenth Armored Division 
smashed into Landschut, cleared 
the town north of the Isar, then} 
crossed the river and began to 
drive Germans from a portion of 
the town south of the Isar.

Six Kindergartens Open 
In Aachen Under AMG 


By Wireless o Tae New Yor Times 

PARIS, April 30—Six “denazi- 
fied’’ kindergartens have been 
opened under the supervision of 
the American Military Govern- 
ment in Aachen, the first big 
German city taken by the Allies. 

The revival of education, which 
is expected soon to cover the 
fourth grade, is being effected 
under a newly appointed German 
director of education, who was 
thrown out of his job as a high- 
school principal in 1933. The first 
policies laid down by SHAEF for 
the control of Gernaan education 
will be largely negative—-their 
purpose will be primarily to 
eliminate all Nazi political and 
militaristic doctrines in German 
schools, Supreme Headquarters 
said. 

The quest for pre-Hitler non- 
Nazi German textbooks led to 
Columbia University’s library, 
part of whose collection is now 
being reprinted in quantity in 
Germany. Twenty-five teachers 
have been approved for 600 chil- 
dren in the first four primary 
grades. Two more kindergartens 
are planned for the suburbs and 
it is expected that the second 
four primary grades will be 
opened later. 

Secondary and higher schools 
may not be opened without the 
permission of the Combined 
Chiefs of Staff.

twenty-two miles northeast of 


Munich near Berglen. 

General Patton’s forces are from 
sixty-three to seventy miles from 
Salzburg in these bridegheads. 

Two more infantry divisions, the 
Seventy-first and Ninety-ninth, 
moved up to the Isar today. The 
former reached the river three 
miles northeast of Landau after a 
nine-mile advance while doughboys 
of the Ninety-ninth made ten miles 
to the Isar west and southwest of 
Landrchut. 


More French Enter Austria 


The French forces on the west-| 


ern flank of the southern advance 
have made new penetration into 
the western end of the enemy’s na- 
tional redoubt. The Poilus crossed 
the Austrian frontier at two points 
north of Bregenz and are pushing 
through the western gateway of 
the Tyrol down the valley of the 
Ill River. Other troops of Gen. 
Jean de Lattrés army are clearing 
the area north of the Austrian 
frontier and northeast of Lake 
Constance. They advanced five 
miles on a broad front today.

One of the prisoners remaining | 
here said that he was the son of

mier. 

Prisoners with access to records 


said that 9,000 captives had died 
of hunger and disease or been shot 
in the past three months and 14,- 
000 more had perished during the 
winter. Typhus was prevalent in 
the camp and the city’s water sup- 
ply was reported to have been con- 
taminated by drainage from 6,000 
graves near the prison. 


39 Cars Full of Bodies 


A short time after the battle 
there was a train of thirty-nine 
coal cars on a siding. The cars 
were loaded with hundreds of bod- 
ies and from them was removed 
at least one pitiful human wreck 
that still clung to life. These vic- 
tims were mostly Poles and most 
of them had starved to death as 
the train stood there idle for sev- 
eral days. Lying alongside a busy 
road near by were the murdered 
bodies of those who had tried to 
escape. 

Bavarian peasants—who trav- 
eled this road daily—ignored both 
the bodies and the horrors inside 
the camp to turn the American 
seizure of their city into an orgy 
of looting. Even German children 
rode by the bodies without a 
glance, carrying stolen clothing. 

In the wake of the storming 
Americans the bodies of the trimly- 
clad German guards lay scattered 
like tenpins, bowled over as they 
sought to flee. The highest of- 





flag, but a Red Cross represent- 
ative said that the real executives!

MOSCOW, April 30—A few old!

follows: 


Order of Day 20 of the Supreme 
Commander in Chief of May 1, 
1945, City of Moscow: 

Comrades of the Red Army and 
Navy, men, sergeants, petty offi- 
cers, officers of the Army and 





emerge from the catacombs of their | 
incredibly devastated capital, rais-| 
ing their clenched right fists and 
shouting “Rot [Red] Front.” The| 
first Soviet declarations of policy| 
have been pasted on the blasted} 
walls. They announce “The Red 
Army has no intention of extermi- 


“2 


ating the German people.” 

These posters, according to lat- 
est reports from Berlin, are now 
being read by small groups of Ger-| 
mans who, reassured, are recover- 
ing their calm in the occupied dis- 
tricts where, it is stated, order is 
being re-established gradually amid 
the ruins. 

Pravda says the Germans are 
crowding into various local com- 
mandants’ headquarters at all 
hours, bringing their documents) 
along and inquiring what is per- 
mitted and what is “‘verboten.” Ap- 
parently one gathers, from these} 
dispatches, they want to know! 
whether they may now move from| 
their cellars to the upper floors | 
of such houses as have them, 
whether they may seek to resume 
their businesses; whether doctors 
may reopen their offices; when and 
where bakeries will resume opera- 
tions. 

In the confused witches’ cauldron 
of Berlin, however, it is apparent 
that a chaotic condition is brewing 
infinitely worse than that which 
prevailed after the last great war, 
which was followed by local revo- 
lutionary outbreaks all over the 
Reich. 

No German Leader Visible 


So far in the confusion, which 
must certainly continue until the 
end of the European war, no polit- 

leader, no Rosa Luxembourg 
or Karl Kautzky, has emerged 
from the moldy saves beneath Ber- 
lin'’s ruins 

Berliners know that German war 
criminals will be tried. Many ap-| 
pear satisfied with this knowledge, 
but many others are dissembling | 
and still taking potshots at the| 
Soviet soldiers. 

One curious Germanic trait is| 
dominant, one judges from these 
latest reports, and that is the em-| 
phatic dependence of the people | 
upon orders, force and direction. A | 
sort of floundering about and a 
mad psychological scramble are 
visible since the collapse of dicta- 
torial nands. One correspond-| 
nt qu a woman named Elsa | 
Klacuert as saying, “A German is| 
made of flesh and bones and dis-| 
cipline.” There is nothing new or| 
surprising in this knowledge, which | 
made Germanic clay such admir- | 
—_ material for molding by Fred-| 
eri Bismarck, Wilhelm and Hit- | 
ler “Tt will be interesting to see} 
what form the inevitable revulsion | 
takes when the bonds of nazidom| 
are completely severed and the) 
people of the Reich emerge from) 
the shadows of dictatorship, like 
the characters in Plato’s cave. 


Berliners Seen Confused 


A Pravda correspondent, 
sent his dispatch yesterday, says | 
the Berliners are “confused in 
conscience and in soul.” He adds: 

“They understand a new existence 
is beginning. They want to know 
what kind of existence. But more 
than anything else, they want the 
shooting to cease and the orders of 
the conquerers announced: to see 
what is going to happen in the 
future.” 

The lack of any form of popular 
unanimity in thinking can be seen | 
from the reported facts. While, on 
the one hand, 16-year-old Harry} 
Hicks—an odd Teutonic name—is 
said to be saying, “I hate Hitler; 
he killed Germany,” other youths 
= is age are still informing hold- 

t German troops of Russian dis- 
positions. 

Underground Berlin, even before 
the Red Army thundered into Hit- 
ler's citadel, was apparently one 
gigantic cave in which distraught 
citizens were jammed together 
“like smoked herring wedged in 
barrels,” as Pravda puts it. 

A Soviet correspondent peered 
into the stinking atmosphere of 
one of these subterranean refuges 
1 which the little man of Berlin 
has been living these past weeks. 

“Little by little,” he wrote, 
“cushions, mattresses, children’s 
cots, frying pans, cooking pots and | 
primus stoves were moved in here. 
Some days ago British airmen de- 
stroyed this region's water pump | 
and electricity; no light, no heat, | 
no gas, no water. We are not

Navy, generals and admirals, and 
working people in the Soviet 
Union. 

Today our country is celebrat- 
ing May 1, the international hol- 
iday of the working people. This 
year the peoples of our country 
meet May Day under conditions 
of the victorious conclusion of the 
great Fatherland war. The dif- 
ficult time when the Red Army 
was repelling enemy troops near 
Moscow and Leningrad and near 
Grozny and Stalingrad, is now 
past and will never return. Now 
our victorious troops are routing 
the enemy armed forces in the 
center of Germany, far beyond 
Berlin on the River Elbe. 

In a short time, Poland, Hun- 
gary, the greater part of Czecho- 
slovakia and a considerable part 
of Austria and the Austrian cap- 
ital, Vienna, were liberated. The 
Red Army has captured East 
Prussia, the nest of German im- 
perialism; Pomerania; the major 
part of Brandenburg, and the 
main districts of the German 
capital, Berlin, having hoisted 
the victory banne; over Berlin. 


800,000 German Captives 


As a result of these offensive 
battles of the Red Army during 
three to four months, the Ger- 
mans have lost more than 800,000 
officers and men as prisoners 
and about 1,000,000 killed. During 
the same period Red Army units 
captured or destroyed about 6,000 
enemy aircraft, about 12,000 
tanks and self-propelled guns, 
more than 23,000 field guns and a 
tremendous amount of other 
types of arms and equipment. It 
should be noted that in these bat- 
tles, side by side with the Red 
Army, Polish, Yugoslav, Czecho- 
slovak, Bulgarian and Rumanian 
troops have successfully advanced 
against the common enemy, 
shoulder to shoulder with the 
Red Army. 

As a result of the devastating 
blows of the Red Army, the Ger- 
man Command was compelled to 
transfer to the Soviet-German 
front dozens of divisions and to 
denude whole sectors on other 
fronts. These circumstances 
helped troops of our Allies to de- 
velop a successful offensive in 
the west, 

At the same time, by simulta- 
neous blows against German 
troops from the East and the 
West, Allied troops and troops 
of the Red Army were able to 
cut German troops into two 


| parts, separated from each other, 


and to accomplish a link-up of 


| Our own and Allied troops into 


jcruel men, but we regard this 
without pity. We remember Len- 
}ingrad and we remember Stalin- 
grad.” 


Russians Speak With Power 


Throughout the wreckage ban- 
ners of surrender hang besmudged 
-—baby clothes, sheets, tablecloths 
|—anything white. But the fanati- 


\cism that has been inoculated into 


the people since 1933 is not yet 
overcome. While Soviet sappers 
seal, one by one, the subway en- 
trances to trap like rats those 
Nazis who still crawl through their 
dark lengths, old men try silly 
tricks like peddling explosive 
cigars to Russians. Some Storm 
Troopers Masquerade as women in 
nurses’ uniforms, then edge up to 
piten grenades. 

But there is a grim final note. 
Per)iners know that Germany must 
r for all the destruction. 
stored. They see Russian military 
police patrols with red armbands 
in the streets—and that is author- 
ity. They see guards at the en- 
trances to the factories—and that 
is power. They see Soviet sol- 
diers, tanks and guns—and that is 
force. They well know that the 
issues of the struggle have been 
decided.

many are numbered. More than 
half of its territory is occupied 
by the Red Army and the troops 
of our Allies. 

Germany has been deprived of 
her most important vital, dis- 
tricts. Industry that remains in 
the hands of Hitlerites is unable 
to supply the German Army with 
a sufficient quantity of arms, 
ammunition and fuel. The Ger- 
man Army’s manpower reserves 
have been exhausted. Germany 
is completely isolated and finds 
herself alone, if one does not 
count her ally, Japan. 

In search of a means for ex- 
tricating themselves from their 
hopeless position, the Hitlerite 
adventurers resort to various 
tricks, even going as far as mak- 
ing advances to the Allies in an 
endeavor to sow dissension in the 
Allied camp. These new roguish 
tricks of the Hitlerites are doomed 
to complete failure. They can 
only hasten the collapse of the 
German troops.

CHAOS AND CIVIL WAR |ASKS REBUILDING BY NAZIS|MURDER OF 140, 000 


IN GERMANY | REPORTED 


LONDON, Apr April 30 (UR) — Re- 
ports emanating mainly from 
Switzerland and Sweden suggested 


tonight that the dwindling slices | 
of Germany still unoccupied had) 


become the scene of utter confu- 
sion and civil war. 

A dispatch from St. Margrethen 
on the Swiss border said that in- 
termittent firing could be heard 
from the vicinity of Bregenz, just 
northeast of Switzerland.  Per- 
sons crossing the border said that 
disorders had broken out among 
the Bregenz citizens. White flags 
were hoisted om some buildings but 
were being puiled down by Hitler 
Youth members. Roads on th 
German side of the border were 
jammed with thousands seeking to 
leave the country. 

It was reported that those living 
in southern Germany again re- 
ferred to themselves as “Aus- 
trians.” A correspondent of The 
London News-Chronicle reported 
from the southern frontier “‘inde- 
scribable and murderous chaos” in 
the southern areas. He said that 
there had been “blood-letting on a 
fantastic scale’ and that foreign 
workers had been fired on and 
massacred by Storm Troop units. 
Looting of food shops and homes 
was reported to be widespread and 
unchecked, 

An unconfirmed Swedish report 
said that German sailors had en- 
gaged in bitter fighting with Storm 
Troopers in Rostock after a mu- 
tiny. The Stockholm Dagéns Ny- 
heter asserted that whole com- 
panies of German marines had mu- 
tinied in Kiel after having been 
told that they would have to fight 
with the infantry in the Hamburg 
area, 


Bender Says | U. ‘Ss. Should Return 
Prisoners for Work in Europe 


WASHINGTON, April 30 (P— 
Immediate return of all German 
prisoners of war to Europe to re- 
build what they have devastated 
was demanded today by Represen- 
tative Bender, Republican, of Ohio. 

Saying that German mistreat- 
ment of American war prisoners 
showed the “depths to which Ger- 
many has sunk under Nazi leader- 
ship,” Mr. Bender asserted in a 
statement that maintenance of 
Nazis in American camps under 
good conditions was “to defeat one 
of the purposes for which this war 
is being fought. 

“I say that the time has come 
when they should be sent back to 
Europe to rebuild under Polish and 
Russian and Czech and French and 
Belgian and Dutch and Yugoslav 


authority the lands they have dev-|included epileptics, schizophrenics, | | smashing

Canada to ¥ Sain in Farm Parley 

OTTAWA, April 30 ()—A Brit-

that Canada would be represented 
in an International Federation of| 
Agriculture, which is to be formed 
in London in October, to perfect 
international planning of food 
production and distribution. Mem- 
bers of the delegation said the

UPHELD BY GERMAN 


UNITED STATES TWELFTH 
ARMY GROUP HEADQUAR- 
TERS, April 24 (Delayed) (UP)— 
Dr. Gustav Wilhelm Schuebbe said 
today the German annihilation in- 
stitute at Kiev killed from 110,000) 
to 140,000 persons “unworthy to| 
live” during the nirme months he! 
worked in it here. 

Schuebbe, 
captured by United States First 
Army troops recently, admitted he 
had murdered about 21,000 persons. 

He told his story voluntarily and 
showed no feeling of guilt but occa- 
sionally became evasive when he 
appeared to sense that his actions 
might be viewed as crimes. 

The annihilation institute was| 
established after the Germans cap- 
tured Kiev in 1941. Schuebbe was 


there about five months before he} 


became head of it. 
The persons “unworthy to live’ 


gypsies, he said. 

Each, doctor at the institute 
“processed” about 100 persons a 
day, but Schuebbe_ said they 
worked only about two or three 
days a week. The victims were 
killed by injections of a morphine 
preparation, Schuebbe said 

Schuebbe admitted, after consid- 
erable questioning, that “no di- 
seased” persons, meaning “politic. | 
ally unreliable persons, foreign na-| 
tionals, Jews and gypsies” were! 
“hospitalized” by the secret service.

Marshal Gregory K. Zhukoff’s 
First White Russian Army cap- 
tured Germany’s legislative cham- 
bers after they had stormed over 
the Moltke River bridge from Mca- 
bit and seized the Ministry of the 
Interior. 

Sweeping across the barricades 
in wide Koenigsplatz they broke 
into the Reichstag and “hoisted ie 
banner of victory,” Moscow said, 

Heinrich Himmler’s Ministry of} 
the Interior lies north of the 
| famous Kroll Opera House, used 
lby the German Parliament after 
the burning of the Reichstag. Here, 
little more than a month before his 
attack on the Soviet Union, Hitler 
told the Nazi assembly » 

“Germany can no longer be ‘sub- 
jugated. She is so strong that no 
combination of Powers could ever 
successfully prevail against her.” 

But as the Russians raised their 
flag over the Reichstag, Marshal 
Stalin said that the days of Hitler’s 
ie were counted. 

The Russians, standing at the 
|Brandenburg Gate and across the 
street from the American Em- 
bassy, were battling into the east- 
ern end of the Tiergarten, where 
|Hitler and Propaganda Minister 
;}Goebbels have been reported di- 
recting Berlin’s defense from a for- 
tified underground headquarters. | 

Along with the Reichstag and| 
the Ministry of the Interior, Mar-| 
shal Zhukoff’s troops captured 200 
city blocks in the heart of the capi-| 
tal. The central postoffice, on the 
east bank of the Spree opposite] 
the Dom (cathedral) also was 
seized by troops battling into the) 
center from Alexanderplatz. The 
fall of these buildings placed Red 
Army assault forces at either end 
of mile-long Unter den Linden. 

Only a mile separated Marshal) 
Zhukoff’s troops at the Reichstag 
from those who, advancing into the| 
central district from the south, had} 
captured Anhalter rail depot Su in-| 
lday. A junction in the center of | 
Berlin would -split the fanatic cal| 
German defenders into a nine- 
jsquare-mile pocket to the north—}| 
in the area of Wedding, Gesund- 
brunnen and Humboldthain—and| 
janother pocket southwest of the| 
Tiergarten. 

In the latter area, Marshal ivan | 
|S. Koneff’s First Ukrainian troops 
captured several blocks of build-| 
ings in the city district of Wilmers- | 
dorf and won the Westkreuz Metro- | 
politan Railway junction, four 
miles southwest of the Reichstag. | 

The mile-long area between) 
Marshal Zhukoff’s two prongs is| 
|packed with all Germany’s major| 
eee | administrative buildings, including | 
Hitler’s great Reich Chancellery. | 

Meanwhile, Marshal Rokossov- | 
isky’s Second White Russian Army | 
| rolled forward from twenty to} 
twenty-three miles across the| 
North German Plains on a great 
100-mile front in conjunction with | 
| elements of Marshal Zhukoff's | 
jarmy due north of Berlin. 

Tearing through faltering de-| 
fenses, Marshal Rokossovsky’s| 
—— shattered the entire enemy | 

ne based on the Stralsund-Berlin 
bee tery and with the capture of | 
Greifswald, Soviet troops 














rolled | 
| within eighteen miles southeast of | 
Stralsund. 

In Germany’s southern region, 
General Yeremenko’s troops top- 
pled the Slovak road center of 
Zilina along with Moravska- 
|}Ostrava, forty-eight miles to the 
northwest. Long under Soviet ar- 
tillery fire, Moravska - Ostrava, 
third city of Czechoslovakia 
guards the northern roads int 
| | Moravia.

U. S. Third Division Takes City | 


Day After False Report of 
42d Division’s Entry 


By RICHARD J. H. JOHNSTON 


By Wireless to Taz New Yorx Trmxs. 


MUNICH, April 30—This eity, 


. ' 
the birthplace of nazism, was cap- 


tured by the United States Third 
Infantry Division this aftesnoon. 
At 5 o’clock all resistance ceased 
except for a suicide squad of twen- 
ty-five Elite Guard troops who held 
out until blasted by a self-pro- 
pelled artillery piece from a build- 
ing near the city’s center in which 
they had barricaded themselves. 
Maj. Gen. John W. (Iron Mike) 
O’Daniel, commanding the Third 
Division, rode into the heart of the 
city shortly after 4 P. M. and in- 
structed Col. Lionel McGarr of 


Phoenix, Ariz., commander of the! 
Thirtieth Regiment, to turn over} 


the city to the Forty-second Di- 
vision and continue pursuit of the 
enemy to the southeast. 

It was incorrectly reported by 
the Seventh Army last night that 
he Forty-second Division had en- 
tered Munich from the north. The 
first troops to enter the city were 
those of Colonel McGarr, whose 
men arrived from the west at 9:45 
A.M. Driving northward through 
ihe city against small arms and 
machine-gun fire Colonel McGarr’s 


men linked up with Forty-second| 


Division troops near the Zoological 
Gardens shortly before noon. 


Residents Welcome Troops 


A strange feature of the capture 
of this most Nazi German city was 
the warm reception the United 
States troops received. Women 


threw flowers at the troops. There | 


was a festive air and residents 
came running out of houses to 
le and wave at the soldiers even 
before the shooting died down. It 
was the gayest welcome for United 
States troops since France. 
No officials were left to surren- 
der Munich. They had left with 


troops who had escaped southeast- | 


ward two days ago. 

General O'’Daniel talked with 
three men who held minor jobs in 
the City Hall, but none felt himself 
sufficiently responsible to offer the 
city to the Americans. They said 
they were members of the Nazi 
party and that they had been or- 
dered by the party to remain be- 
hind to take care of the 470,000 
persons in Munich. 

Munich's fall came _ suddenly, 
after troops had worked their way 
through streets in which there 
were occasional outbursts of rifle 
and machine-gun fire. Enemy ar- 


+ 


uulery fire had ceased early in the 


Nine hundred American prison- 
ers were found this morning locked 
in box cars on a railroad siding. 
They had been placed there two 
days ago by Nazis, who said there 
would be bombing of the city and 
that the railway yards would be

U-BOAT DEFEATED, 
BRITISH DECLARE 


Sir James Somerville Asserts 
Allies Have Curbed Attacks 
to One in 350 Ships 


Admiral Sir James Somerville 
of the British Admiralty delega- 
tion in Washington revealed yes- 
terday that the defeat of German 
U-boats in the Atlantic by Allied 
navies is virtually complete. 

The British Information Services 
here released an advice from him 
in which he said at a luncheon 
given in Detroit by the Economic 
Club that so complete is the de- 
feat in the Battle of the Atlantic 
that one ship in 350 is now being 
attacked. 

On the other side of the world 
in the Battle of the Pacific, the 
admiral said: “It is our pride and 
pleasure that the two Pacific 
Fleets, British and American, are 
now fighting side by side to bring 
about unconditional surrender of 
Japan.” 

“On our side, I can say with ab- 
solute sincerity,” he stated, ‘“‘that 
nowhere in the world has the 
work of the American Navy re- 
ceived warmer praise and appreci- 
ation than in the British Fleet.” 

Reviewing the achievements of 
the British Navy during five and 
a half years of war, the admiral 
pointed out that some four mil- 
lion tons of vitally needed war sup- 
plies had been safely delivered by 
way of Arctic ports to the Rus- 
sians and that more than 90 per 
cent of the cargoes intended for 
Russia arrived safely. 

This was accomplished despite 
the heavy losses of the early days 
of the war, when 2,000,000 tons 
of British merchant shipping were 
sunk in the first eleven months of 
fighting. 

The Battle of the Mediterranean 
was costly to the British Fleet too, 
said the admiral. “By the time the 
Italians had been knocked out, 
Britain had lost one battleship, two 
aircraft carriers, sixteen cruisers, 
forty-five destroyers and forty- 
four submarines.” 

The superiority of the Allied 
navies was demonstrated forcibly 
in the Normandy landings, he con- 
tinued, when some 640 guns rang- 
ing from 6 to 16 inch protected the 
soldiers on the beaches—an aver- 
age British cruiser has only eight 
heavy-caliber guns. 

The admiral also revealed that 
models of the remarkable British- 
made artificial harbors, which 
played such a vital part in the 
early days after the Normandy 
landings, would soon be exhibited 
lin the United States.

MOSCOW, April 30 (U.P)—Edou- 
lard Herriot, former Premier of 
France, who was liberated from 
|German captivity by the Red 
Army, arrived here today with his 
wife, and those who knew him in 
France said he was the same Her- 
riot—the hero of France’s ‘“com- 
mon man.” 

He is much thinner than former- 
ly, but he survived captivity with 
remarkable equanimity. He appears 
}not only physically fit but mentally 
| disposed to take his place again in 
French political life, and his power- 
ful personality is expected to make 
|a fresh imprint on the evolving po- 
litical situation in the “new 
France.” 

M. Herriot, a guest of the French 
|Ambassador here, Gen. Georges 
Catroux, said that he had not met 
former Premiers Edouard Daladier 
and Paul Reynaud or Gen. Mau- 
rice-Gustave Gamelin, the French 
Commander in Chief in 1939. He 
said that he owed his life to a Ger- 
man doctor who at the last mo- 
ment rejected Gestapo orders to 
transfer him ¢o a clinic in Berlin, 
|where, he believes, the Germans 
|would have done him to death as 
| they did Kurt Schuschnigg, former 
|Chancellor of Austria. 
| During an interval of several 
|hours while the Gestapo auto- 
|mobile returned to near-by Berlin 
| for fresh instructions, the Russians 
|approached Babelsberg, where M. 
|Herriot was confined. The Ger- 
;mans placed road blocks along the 
|Berlin highway and the Gestapo 
|}car never returned, 
| M. Herriot did not know how 
jlong he would remain in Moscow, 
nor had he made any plans for

jernment viewed the move with

that “beyond notice of it, we do not

Commission’s Trip Deferred 
| By Wireless to Tux New Yorx Times. 
| LONDON, April 30—American, 
| British and French members of 
| the inter-Allied Control Commission 
|for Austria are unlikely to move 
}to Vienna to join their Russian 
|counterparts, informed political 
quarters said tonight, until nego- 
tiations now in progress have 
finally settled the four Powers’ 
}zones of occupation and the Con- 
trol Commission’s relationship to 
the newly formed Austrian Provi- 
sional Government. 

American and British represent- 
atives on the commission are al- 
ready waiting in Italy to enter 
Austria, it was stated. 

Amplifying earlier irritated 
comment on the formation of the 
Vienna Government, British quar- 
ters explained that the British 
Government had been “informed 
but not consutted” about the plans. 
|It was noted that the Russians did 
not immediately recognize this 
|Government, thus somewhat at- 
|tenuating the force of the fait ac- 
|compli facing the Allies. 

The Times of London will say 
tomorrow that “the formation of a 
free and representative Govern- 
ment in Austria is most welcome,” 
but will regret that “this is by no 
;}means the first instance since the

horrified when told what the Allies 
had found in German concentra-

He said that his wife, a smail 
but vivacious woman, had been a 
tower of strength to him during 
captivity. He was hungry for news 
of the outside world but refused 
to make any comment when in- 
formed that Marshal Henri-Phi-

France.

PARIS, April 30—A plane will 
bring M. and Mme. Herriot to 
France. Almost certainly a Cab- 
inet post will be offered to M. Her- 
riot when the Government is re- 
vised after the local elections, 
which will be finished on May 13. 

Gen. Charles de Gaulle is ex- 
pected to send one of his assist- 
ants to Switzerland to meet M. 
Reynaud. General de Gaulle takes 
a special interest in M. Reynaud, 
who made him Vice Minister of 
War in 1940. Asa result, General 
de Gaulle was in London at the 
time of the armistice and thus he 
could make the appeal for resist- 
ance that started him on the road 
to his present position. General 
de Gaulle takes less interest in M. 
Daladier, who signed the Munich 
agreement. There seems to be no 
chance that he will take M. Dala- 
dier into the Cabinet. 

Pierre Laval’s request for asy- 
lum in Switzerland has been re- 
fused by the Swiss, who offered a

Government would let Laval come

Austria Excites Speculation 


By Wireless to Tat New Yorx Tres. 

PARIS, April 30—The departure 
today of the French delegation for 
Austria has drawn the attention of 
official circles here to the outlook 
for Central Europe as an independ- 
ent Austria seems about to reap- 
pear. 

Information received here in in- 
formed circles is that the Ameri- 
cans oppose detaching Klagenfurt 
from Austria to give it to Yugo- 
slavia. The American idea is un- 
derstood to be that Klagenfurt is 
Austrian, while Trieste should be- 
come an international seaport at 
the disposal of Austria. 

The question asked here is how 
far Marshal Tito will have Russian 
support for these claims, inasmuch 
as he has had it for his regime, 
which has made a treaty allying 
Yugoslavia with Soviet Russia. 

Meanwhile it is understood that 
the Soviet Government is increas- 
ingly apprehensive that Austria 
may become part of a Catholic 
Central European bloc, which the 
Russians believe the Vatican is 
seeking to create. The Russians are 
said to regard such a move as the 
latest form of a western “cordon 
sanitaire” against Russia which 
Moscow has feared for a quarter 
of a century. 


42 NAZIS FLEE TO SWEDEN 


Arrive at Ystad in Steamer and 
Ask to Be Interned 


The German steamer Nassau ar- 
rived in the south Swedish port of 
Ystad yesterday morning with a 
crew of thirty-seven and forty-two 
members of Nazi anti-aircraft units 
aboard, all of whom asked to be 
interned in Sweden, the Swedish 
radio said in a domestic broadcast 
reported by the Federal Communi- 
cations Commission. 

According to the broadcast, the 
soldiers were taken into police 
custody and the steamer, manned 
by its crew, was escorted to Karls- 
krona. 

The Nassau was said to have 
left Swinemuende on the Bay of 
Pommerania last night.

BLECTION RESULT 


Leftists’ Gains in Paris and 
Other Cities Minimized— 
New Balloting Awaited 


By G. H. ARCHAMBAULT 
By Wireless to THz New Yor« Times. 

PARIS, April 30—Although defi- 
nite results of yesterday’s munici- 
pal elections in Paris were an- 
nounced tonight, the general politi- 
cal picture in the provinces is still 
blurred and is likely to remain so 
until the second ballots two weeks 
hence. 

In the capital there has been a 
clear trend toward the left, to 
which the Communists pointed to- 
day as a triumph for their party. 
But this claim ig disputed by their 
opponents until the figures have 
been subjected to detailed anal- 
ysis. Objective observers recall 
that Paris is not France and that 
there were times under the Third 
Republic when the capital differed 
politically from the rest of the 
country. 

[The Communist party re- 
ceived approximately 25 per cent 
of all votes cast in yesterday’s 
municipal elections, The Asso- 
ciated Press reported. The party 
won thirty-seven of the ninety 
municipal Council seats in Paris 
and appeared likely to have 
gained substantial control of the 
city goyernments of Marseille, 
Lyon, Lille and Bordeaux. ] 


Communists’ Skill Admitted 


It is conceded, in any case, that 
the Communist party played a 
very skillful hand in supporting 
every ticket capable of being de- 
scribed as republican, democratic 
or anti-Fascist. This enables it to 
claim a landslide in Paris, whose 
Municipal Council will be com- 
posed of twenty-four moderates, 
nineteen centrists and forty-seven 
Leftists, compared with forty-six 
moderates, nineteen centrists and 
twenty-five Leftists in 1935, after 
the last previous loca] elections. 

In view of this result, the Com- 
munists contend that the electorate 
has declared in favor of a 
“struggle against trusts, a purge 
of collaborationists, death for 
{Marshal Henri-Philippe] Pétain, 
the nationalization of industry and 
credit and structural reform gen- 
erally.” They have appealed t 





White Sone to Give Out 
Peace News When Right 


By The United Press. 
WASHINGTON, April 30— 
Jonathan Daniels, Presidential 


press secretary, said today that | 


a White House announcement 
would be made of any peace 
negotiations with Germany when 
“anything can be said with au- 
thority.” There was no indica- 
tion that an announcement was 
imminent. 

Mr. Daniels added that Presi- 
dent Truman “will take proper 
notice” of an actual German 
surrender. He referred to a proc- 
lamation the President has pre- 
pared to read over the radio 
when V-E Day comes. 

Director Elmer Davis of the 
Office of War Information called 
at the White House to outline to 
President Truman the vast ex- 
tent of OWI operations. As he 
left the President’s office, re- 
porters asked Mr. Davis if he 
knew when the war in Europe 
was going to end. He said no. 

“Do you think anybody knows 
when the war will end there?” 
he was asked; and he again 
said no.

It is also conceded that, on broad 
lines, the Communists enlisted the 
support of all malcontents, notably 
women, whose principal concern in 
this, their first, election was to 
protest against insufficient food 
supplies. Again on broad lines, the 
Communists gained at the expense 
of the Socialists, who nevertheless 
held their ground relatively be- 
cause they gained from the Radi- 
cal-Socialists, who appear to have 
failed in their aspirations to be- 
come the principal

It was widely reported through- 
out’ the day that Prime Minister 
Churchill had conferred by tele- 
phone with Foreign Secretary An- 
thony Eden at San Francisco and 
was keeping in touch with both 
President Truman and Premier 
Stalin. 


The possibility that the Prime|

members of Parliament to be in- 
undated with requests for visitors’ 
seats. 

A German acknowledgment 
that Count Bernadotte, as a peace 
emissary, had been conferring 
with some Reich authorities in 
Aabenraa, Denmark, came finally 
from the Nazi-controlled Danish 
radio.

Dr. Scharping asked his German

Two Bernadotte-Himmler Talks 


MALMO, Sweden, April 30 “R»— 
Free Danish press reports said 
Count Folke Bernadotte had con- 
ferred with Heinrich Himmler to- 
day for the second time in two 
days at Aabenraa on the German- 
Danish border. 


Himmler was said by the Free 


Danes to have talked with Count 
Bernadotte for three hours Sun- 


supposed to have turned over the 
Western Allies’ rejection of Himm- 
ler’s capitulation proposal. Himm- 
ler returned to a headquarters 
near Hamburg for the night and 
went back to Aabenraa this morn- 
ing. 

Two Swedish Foreign Office of- 
ficials and a Swedish military traf- 
fic expert boarded a special plane 
at Malmoe for Denmark today. In 
Stockholm the Foreign Office said 
it had no confirmation of reports 
that the delegation, headed by 
Eric von Post of the Political Ac- 
tion, might be en route to join 
Count Bernadotte in connection 
with a peace mission. 


Truman Sees No Rush News 





WASHINGTON, April 30 UPi— 
President Truman indicated late 
today that there was not likely to 
be any important news from the 
White House tonight. 

He was just about to leave the 
Executive Mansion this afternoon 
when he received word that Ad- 
miral William D. Leahy wanted to 
talk to him. 

When he came back he was 
asked by reporters if it meant any- 
thing. 

“It was nothing important,” Mr. 
Truman said, as he finally depart- 
ed for the nearby Blair House, his 
temporary abode, at 5:50 P. M. 
Eastern war time. 

“TI think you’re safe for the 
night,” he advised the newsmen, 
who had been keeping a day-long 
vigil in anticipation of possible 
European war developments.

Three islands north of Okinawa 
in the Ryukyu chain were brought 
under air attack by Pacific Fleet | 
carrier planes Sunday and Mon-| 
day Objectives were the major} 
base of Amami, where the enemy} 
has airfields and a naval station, | 
and the near-by smaller islands of | 
Tokumo and Kikai, which with} 
Amami make up the Amami} 
group 

Landing craft, a coastal ship, | 
fuel dumps, barracks and airfield 
installations were bombed,, strafed | 
and hit with rockets on the three} 
islands. The communiqué men-| 
tioned five enemy aircraft de-| 
stroyed on the ground, indicating | 
that the bases were not strongly | 
defended by air. | 

Search planes of Fleet Air Wing | 
One, while scouring enemy ship-| 
ping in Japanese and Ryukyu | 
coastal waters on Sunday and 
Monday, spread confusion and de-| 
struction among convoys of small} 

irgo craft.on which the Ryukyu 
Islands depend for supplies. 

On Sunday the search aircraft} 
bombed two small cargo ships in| 
the Ryukyus, leaving one sinking | 
and the other burning furiously. | 
Other planes of this busy wing set | 
fire to three small cargo ships in| 
the East China Sea the same day.

by landing on the East Plaza, The 
ship, piloted by Lieut. Stewart R. 
Graham, came from Brooklyn in 
connection with a Seventh War

Graham lowered the ship down to- 
ward the waiting seaman, who 
grasped a suspended hook and was 
lifted into the cockpit. 





the New York chapter of the Sons 
of the American Revolution, which 
sponsored the rally, told 2,500 per- 
sons in the audience that the site 
was a fitting place to launch the 
Seventh War Loan because of the 





{ 


historic memories which surround 
the spot. 

“When George Washington was 
inaugurated it was without ques- 


| 





day people are just as loyal and 
patriotic as the old Revolutionary 
heroes.” 

Mr. Van Wyck laid a wreath of 
red, white and blue flowers at the 
foot of the statue of Washington 
which stands on the steps. He said 
it was in tribute not only to the 
first President of the United 
States but also to the “brave boys 
who are fighting for his ideals to- 
day.” 

One hundred and fifty honor 
students from George Washington 
High School were led by Leslie 
Daggett, president of the General 
Organization, in a pledge to the 


flag. Gardner Osborn, executive | 


director of the Federal Hall Me- 
morial Museum, presided at the 
rally. 

In Rockefeller Center yesterday 
the cradle that will support ‘the 
largest ship model ever built,” was 
put into place in the Lower Plaza. 
So large that the flight deck will 
reach street level, the model air- 
craft carrier, 103 feet long and 
16 feet wide, will be called The 
Fighting Lady. 

The assembling of the ship, 
which will be “commissioned” at 
the official opening of the drive, 
will take about ten days. Today 
the stern section of the flat-top 
will be brought from the navy 
yard in Brooklyn, where it was 
built.

from Rangoon, Burma's capital.| 
Whether Pegu, fifty miles above|

Drive for Rangoon Is Swift 
By TILLMAN DURDIN 


By Wireless to Tur New Yors Tres. 

IN SOUTH BURMA, April 28 
(Delayed)—South of Toungoo the 
battle front has moved fast and 
far. Rushing toward Rangoon are 


tanks, armored cars, trucks, jeeps, | 


caravans of huge tank and bull- 
dozer transporters, radio cars and 
almost every other type of motor 
vehicle known to modern mechan- 
ized warfare. 

Bridgeless sandy-bottomed 
streams are almost as much of 
a hindrance as the Japanese. 
Our planes or the Japanese have 
knocked down the spans over the 
streams and vehicles must grind 
slowly along detours and emer- 
gency crossing sites. But some 
days advances of more than fifty 
miles have been made. 

Fast though our spearheads 
move, air-dropped supplies keep 
pace and a constant parade of 
transports moves south and back 
again, emptying bales of ammuni- 
tion, gasoline and food tied to 
parachutes that alight beside rest- 
less aggregations of landbound 
men and machines. 

Air s.»ply has been one of the 
miracles of this advance. Not once 
have tanks, trucks or jeeps been 
held up by shortages of gasoline.

PEGU, Burma, April 30 (UP)— 

Nearly 300 American and British 

prisoners of war—the first to be 

liberated in Burma—reached Brit- 
lish Fourteenth Army lines last 


Inight and today. About 120 more 
jare expected momentarily. 








All British and American pris- 
oners who were physically fit left 
the Rangoon City Jail Thursday 
night and marched three days and 
nights to a village four miles 
jnorth of Pegu after the Japanese 
jcommandant released them. 

“As soon as the Japs left we made 

British flags out of blankets,” a 
|major said, “but the first night a 
\fighter plane strafed us, killing 
our ranking officer. I then got a 
jnative guide and disguised myself 
as a Burmese and walked to a 
British post. They sent a company

ROOSEVELT CALLED 
‘SPIRIT OF PARLEY’ 


Chinese Paper Says Success Is 
Assured if Every Delegate 
Remembers Late President 


If every delegate to the San 
Francisco Security Conference will 
remember “the great name of 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, we can rest 
assured that the San Francisco 
meeting will be successfully con- 
cluded,”’ the Chinese newspaper Ta 
Kung Pao said today in an editori- 
broadcast by the Chungking ra- 

io. ° 

The broadcast was directed to 
North America in English and re- 
ported by the Federal Communi- 
cations Commission. 

Paying tribute to Mr. Roosevelt 
as one who “employed his great 
wisdom to design, to direct and to 
create the peace,” Ta Kung Pao 
said that although he had died be- 
fore the conference opened, “his 
spirit must be hovering over the 
parley and looking at the gather- 
ing of the United Nations.” For 
this reason, Ta Kung Pao said: 

“We must remind all the dele- 
gates of the United Nations not to 
forget Mr. Roosevelt and to think 
of his great contributions and sac- 
rifices.” 

The Ta Kung Pao editorial as- 
serted: 

“With hundreds of delegates 
gathered in San Francisco to dis- 
cuss the post-war peace formula, 
we must not forget one particular 
person, the late President Frank- 
lin Delano Roosevelt. This man 
led us over the road of victory. 
He sacrificed his life for the vic- 
tory of the war and for the peace 
after the war. He came to the aid 
of all the United Nations by lead- 
ing America into the war with her 
tremendous resources and man- 
power for the final victory. 

“Though Mr. Roosevelt had left 
us when the conference was 
opened, his last thought was with 
the conference which he had 
planned. His spirit must be look- 
ing at the gathering of the United 
Nations. If only every one of the 
conferees would remember the 
great name of Franklin D. Roose- 
velt, we can rest assured that the 
San Francisco meeting will be suc- 
cessfully concluded. 

“According to the ideals of de- 
mocracy, all the nations should be 
equal, and there is no difference 
between the powerful and weak. 
However, from the realistic view 
of the war, naturally the contribu- 
tions of the big and powerful na- 
tions are comparatively larger. 

“The Soviet Union has contrib- 
uted the most by her all-out re- 
sistance against Germany’s inva- 
sion and turned the tide of the 
war—the unyielding spirit of Great 
Britain and her Atlantic Fleet has 
constituted a protecting force 
throughout the world—and the re- 
sources supplied by the United 
States to all the fronts of the 
world as well as her heroic troops 
which have fought m the various 
theatres of the war have become 
the great artery of this anti- 
aggression war. 

“All these are the indispensable 
conditions for the winning of the 
war, yet we still wish to point out 
that the world after all is not sole- 
ly possessed by the big and power- 
ful nations. In a peaceful and 
well-being world all the nations 
should live like a big happy fam- 
ily, without any discrimination and 
difference. Evéry single nation and 
individual should be respected. 

“If we wish the peace to be well 
settled this time, naturally there 
should be the coordination of va- 
rious conditions in which the self- 
denial of the big nations is the 
most fundamental.” 


TO DELAY RETURN OF DEAD 
War Department Will Give Pol- 
icy When Peace Comes 











Special to THE New Yorw Times. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—No 
military dead can be returned to 
the United States from any zone 
of operations until all hostilities 
end, the War Department an- 
nounced today, reaffirming a pol- 
icy established earlier in the war. 

Pointing out that Germany’s 
imminent fall has kindled “false 
hopes” in many families that the 
soldier dead in Europe could be 
veturned here after V-E Day, the 
statement said that in order to 
win the war without delay in the 
Pacific, ali shipping space must 
be diverted to troops and supplies. 

While sympathetic to the feel- 
ings of the families, the War De- 
partment is standing on its policy 
as enunciated in 1943. 

When world peace comes, the 
Quartermaster General will ascer- 
tain which next-of-kin wish their 
soldier dead returned. At that 
time appropriate plans will be an- 
nounced. 


CANCER DRIVE EXTENDED 


$5,000,000 Campaign to Go on 
Until May 15 


April 30 of the $5,000,000 national 
drive to control cancer, was an- 
nounced yesterday by Eric A. 
Johnston, campaign chairman of 
the American Cancer Society, and 
president of the United States 
Champer of Commerce. 

The announcement of Post- 
master General Frank C. Walker, 
that the 43,000 United States post- 
offices would cooperate in routing 
mail contributions addressed to 
“Cancer, Local Post Office,” to 
designated State depots, has cre- 
ated a heavy public response, the 
announcement said. 

Before President Roosevelt died, 
he designated April as Cancer 
Control Month, pursuant to an act 
of Congress that dedicated this 
month each year to the aid of 
cancer control.

So late was the Experiment

It was announced today that two 


members of the board of directors 
of this corporation, Ennemond Bi- 
zot and Maurice Cuzin, had been 
taken into custody last week and 
that a warrant had been issued for 
the arrest of Charles Gillet, chair-

It is alleged that France-Rayonne 
represents a typical instance of 
Franco-German industrial collabo- 
ration under Adolf Hitler’s 
European Order.” Two German ob- 
servers were placed on the board of 


account. Similar action is now ex- 
pected against several 
firms. 

Hitherto, the Advanced Resis-

criminal prosecutions for collabora-

stricted to journalists, police offi- 
cials who worked with the Gestapo, 
and men who enlisted in the Legion 


to Combat Bolshevism, or Vichy’s

industrialists and others who made 
great profits from cooperation with 
the Germans had merely been fined. 


HIGH POSTS FOR NEGROES 


Kentucky Governor Says Two 
Will Get State Positions 


FRANKFORT, Ky., April 30 (® 


—Governor Willis said today that 


two members of the Negro race 
would be appointed to high admin- 
istrative posts for the first time in 


“New 


ciety, composed of the civilian 
schools that gave primary training 
to thousands of American pilots as 
well as the complete flying courses 
to the British cadets sent here first 
in 1941, when all England was im-

Citing training advantages here| 
that would not have been possible 
in England, Mr. Weishaar de- 
scribed how the whole of Europe 
was plotted against a map of Texas 
and surrounding States, with the 
little city of Terrell, Tex., serving 
as London and other points as far 
away as Albuquerque, N. M., which} 
served as Warsaw for bomber 
training missions. 

The idea began, according to the 
society’s statement, in August, 
1940, when Capt Harold Balfour, 
RAF, now Under-Secretary of 
State for Air, conferred with Max 
Balfour of the Spartan School at 
Tulsa, Maj. William F. Long of 
Dallas, Maj. C. C. Mosely of Glen- 
dale, Calif, and Hal S. Darr of

The Experiment Perilous headed 
back to sea and maintained its 


course to IWO, where it landed. 


Weather was responsible for the 
second adventure of Lieutenant 
Flewellen and his crew. Flying to 
Kyushu in the early morning April 
27 for a “milk run” attack on air- 
fields, they struck thick weather. | 
“We lost track of the other B-29’s 
before we went into the target 
from the assembly point,” Ser- 
geant Gilford said. 

“We tried to climb up and get 
out of it,” Lieutenant Flewellen 
added, “then we headed north. We 
went clear up to the northwest cor- 
ner of Kyushu, a distance of 160 
miles from the original target. 

“Then we started back down the 
coast, looking for targets. All of 
a sudden we saw land. It looked 
like Nagasaki, but the city itself 
was closed in, so we began to 
make a run on a near-by town.” 

Before the run had got well 
started, however, Sergeant Benson 
suddenly saw the clouds break 
away over the sprawling city of 
Nagasaki and its great port, 
around which milled more than 
100 small vessels. One large ship 
began twisting and turning, smoke 
billowing from her funnel. Then 
she stopped, apparently undecided, 
as the Experiment Perilous veered 
for a run across the dock. 

Sergeant Putney, watching from 
his gun position, saw two big ex- 
plosions in the dock area. There 
was no anti-aircraft fire, indicating 
that the Japanese were entirely 
surprised. The lone B-29 wheeled 
and headed south. Several hours 
later the pilot put the huge craft 
down at Saipan, with ten minutes 
of gas left in his tanks.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 30—In 
one of the tensest and most dra- 
matic moments of the United Na-| 

ns Conference, the chairmen of 
only three of the forty-six partici- 
pating delegations stood with For- 
eign Commissar V. M. Molotoff of 
Soviet Russia this afternoon in a 


vain attempt to block an imme- 
diate invitation to Argentina. 
Defeated on this point at a heat- 
ed session of the steering com- 
mittee in the morning, Mr. Molo- 
toff had upset normal procedure 
by appealing to the whole body 
of delegates in public assembly. 
With Anthony Eden, British 
Foreign Secretary, presiding, the 


by Secretary Stettinius 
in he asserted that the issue 
had “thoroughly threshed 
out” by the steering committee, 
which had recommended inviting 
Argentina to participate at once 
in the deliberations. 

Amid some shouts of “no, no” 
from the galleries, Mr. Eden said 
he would first ask those leaders 
of delegations to stand who wished 
to defer the invitation. 
cluding Mr. Molotoff, arose. A 
Conference official said that they 
were Russia, Belgium, Czechoslo- 
vakia, Norway, Yugoslavia, Iran 
and New Zealand. 

When Mr. Eden asked those fa- 

“the present admission” of 
entina to stand, the heads of 
y-eight delegations did so. 

Then he called for a conclusive 
vote on the question of “admitting 
in accordance with the 


a speech 
ie which 


been 


agreed to by the steering/| 


nittee this morning.” 

This time the original twenty- 
ght delegations favoring it had 

thirty-one, while some 
f Russia's supporters in the first 
ote abstained, making the final 
te 31 to 4 in support of the posi- 
on of the United States, Great 
3ritain and the Pan-American re- 
publics. 

The countries voting with the 
Soviet this time were said to be 
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and 
Greece.

cedure of the plenary session, ap- 
pealed from the action of the ex- 
ecutive committee to the whole 
body of the conference for the de- 
lay in consideration of the Argen- 
tine question. 

While he defended the delay as 
proper because question had just 
come to the committee and re- 
quired study, delegates retiring to 
the lounges during the long session 
were quick to speculate that the 
Soviet was playing for time and 
for a “deal” on recognition of the 
Polish Lublin government. 

Mr. Molotoff himself suggested 
that this was his motive when he 
repeatedly 
and Argentine situations in’ the 
course of his speech, which brought 
a series of retorts from Latin- 
American delegates and an at- 
tempt at conciliation by Foreign 
Minister Henri Spaak of Belgium, 
who said he believed the Soviet 
request was “reasonable” and 
should be accepted. 


The situation provided a test for| 


parliamentary capacities of 
Anthony Eden, British Foreign 
Minister, who presided for the 
first time over a plenary session 
as one of the four conference 
presidents 

Opening the session on schedule 
at 3:30, he recognized Ambassador 
Guillermo Belt Ramfrez, chairman 
of the Cuban delegation, to report 
on the morning action of the Ex- 
ecutive Committee. 

Mr. Belt reported that the com- 
mittee recommended the immedi- 
ste seating of representatives of 
the Ukrainian and White Russian 
Soviet Republics. There was no 
objection and Mr. Eden ruled the 
recommendation adopted. 

Mr. Belt then reported that the 


the 


itine Republic also be seated 
n diately When Mr. Eden 
asked if there were any objections, 
Mr. Molotoff rose, was recognized, 
and went 
preter, who translated the speech 
a few sentences at a time. 


Molotoff Explains Stand

The 
raised only today and therefore the 
Soviet delegation would like to 
have time for themselves and 
others to familiarize itself with the 
question and ask that the question 
be postponed for a few days,” Mr. 
Molotoff said 

“Everybody knows that Argen- 
tina held a special position in this 
war against our common foe. Her 
policies were not always popular.” 

In support of his view he quoted 
statements by former Secretarty 
Hull and the late President Roose- 
velt regarding Argentina as a cen- 
ter of fascism “in this hemisphere.” 

Mr. Molotoff said that he had 
only the word of some Latin 
American governments that the 
situation in the Argentine had 


changed for the better and Russia| 


would like to study the situation 
to see if it had really changed. 
Bringing up Poland as a parallel, 
he asked what would happen if, 
without 
invited to this 
Poland, which “was one of the most| 
active participants in our strug-|

“If we invite the Argentine,|

jon, “all of the invitations to this 
|conference have been approved 
romemasnens / by the four inviting 
| Governments, a good rule and we 
}do not like to depart from it. I 
think we value our unanimity and 
think we should want to give am- 
ple csonsideration to the new ques- 
|tion, therefore, we would not like 
|the question of the Argentine to be 
settled in a hurry.” 

He declared that the request was 

the oniy one being made by the So- 
|viet delegation and asked for sup- 
| port, 
| Chairman Eden recognized Al- 
iberto Lleras Camargo, Colombian 
Minister for Foreign Affairs, who 
|was the first of a series of Latin- 
|Americans who urged immediate 
|seating of Argentina. 
He pointed out that the United 
|States had not objected at Mexico 
|City to inviting the Argentine back 
jinto the family of American re- 
ipublics if she fulfilled certain con- 
iditions, and added that “the word 
of honor of the other American 
nations on this point is here af- 
\firmed.” 

Ezequiel Padilla, Foreign Minis- 
ter of Mexico, asserted that all the 
world paid homage to Poland, but 
that since the other nations pres- 
jent had recognized what was done 
by three powers at Yalta, were 
jthey not now going to recognize 
likewise what was done at Mexico 
| City. 

Answering charges that Argen- 
tina was Fascist, he declared a dis- 
tinction should be made between 
the Government and the people 
and expressed faith that Argen- 
tina, having signed the Declaration 
of Chapultepec, would adhere to its 
Democratic principles. 

Victor Andres Belaunde, speak- 
|ing for Peru, said that the seating 
lof Argentina was “a question of 
faith in the action agreed on at 
| the Mexico City Conference.” 

Paul Jenri Spaak, Belgian For- 
eign Minister, said that while Mr. 
|Molotoff had spoken in a language 
fit for a just cause, and some had 
jtalked in the language of clarity, 
|he would like to talk in the lan- 
guage of conciliation. 
| He said no question of principle

was involved in the dispute, but 
only one of procedure. The So- 
viet delegation, he said, was 
“merely asking” for a postpone- 
mént to assure a unanimous vote. 

“This seems wise to me—a rea- 
sonable and legitimate request,” he 
said. 

Closing the debate, Mr. Stettinius 
set forth the actions of the Steer- 
ing and Executive Committees, as- 
serted that the American Repub- 
lics “feel Argentina has complied” 
with the Mexico City resolution 
and appealed to the conferees “to

URGES NEW CABINET POST 


Mrs. Rogers Sees Truman on 
Place for Veteran Affairs 


Special to Tux New York Times. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Rep- 
resentative Edith Nourse Rogers, 
Republican, of Massachusetts, after 
a call at the White House today 
said that she had discussed with 
President Truman the possibility of 
a Cabinet place for the adminis- 
trator of veterans affairs as pro- 
vided in a bill she has introduced. 

President Truman, she declared, 
was “tremendously inteersted in 
veterans problems” and had au- 
thorized her to say that he was 
going to work out improvements 
in their behalf. . 

As organized, she added, the 
Veterans Administration cannot 
handle the great tasks of supply 


and medical facilities for veterans| 


and of adjudicating veteran 
claims under the GI Bill of Rights.

NO WHISKY ALCOHOL 
IN SIGHT, SAYS WPB 


Special to Tuz New Yoru Timzs, 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Pro- 
duction of industrial alcohol must 
be continued at maximum levels 
to meet all the requirements of the 
present war program, the War} 
Production Board warned today. 

According to an agency spokes- 
man, needs for alcohol for war 
purposes were steadily increasing 
and all distilleries would be re- 
quired to meet the estimated de- 
mand, leaving none available for 
the manufacture of whisky. 

The WPB official pointed out at 
the time of the last “liquor hoil- 
day,” reserve stocks were approxi- 
mately 80,000,000 gallons. Present 
indications are that stocks at the 
end of 1945 will drop to about 36,- 
000,000 gallons. 

As the agency presented its 
estimates for this year to its In- 
dustrial Alcohol Producers Indus- 
try Advisory Committee, figures 
showed that gallons of 190 proof 
alcohol were needed as follows: 

Direct military and lend-lease, 
94,000,000; synthetic rubber pro- 
duction, 343,000,000; indirect mili- 
tary and civilian needs, 165,000,- 
000, and anti-freeze manufacture, 
36,000,000. 

The committee recommended 
that, if increased alcohol facilities 
were required, they should be in 
the form of additions to existing 
grain-alcohol plants, rather than 
by means of new construction. 
WPB replied that it had not yet! 
reached a decision on the necessity | 
of additional facilities.

MESSAGE TO PARLEY 


Exiled Government Asks for! 


Amendments to Dumbarton 
Oaks Proposals 


BROAD ‘SECURITY’ SOUGHT 


Also at San Francisco, Krzycki 
Slav Congress Head, Tells 
af Polish Labor Bid 


By JOHN H. CRIDER 
Special to Tur New Yoru Traces 

SAN FRANCISCO, April 30— 
The Polish Government-in-Exile in 
London communicated to the Unit- 
ed Nations Conference on Interna- 
tional Organization today its pro- 
posals for amendment of the 
Dubmarton Oaks document. 

The suggestions were specific on 
the urgency of broadened world 
“security.” 

The communication came to the 
conference presidents, and was 
made public as the delegates strug- 


, 


gled with the difficult problem of | 


inviting a Polish delegation, with 


the Soviet delegation still insisting} 


that the provisional Lublin Gov- 
ernment be invited even though| 
the Anglo-American interpretation 
of the Yalta agreement was to the| 
effect that only a broadened Polish 
Government could be invited. 

Major changes in the Dumbarton | 
Oaks document recommended by} 
the Polish government in London, | 
and communicated to the confer- 
ence presidents by J. Ciechanowski, 
that Government's Ambassador to 
the United States, were: 

The “inadvisability” of moves to 
get up a rigid world security sys-| 
tem while hostilities continue; re-| 
vision of the “veto” formula for the 
Big Powers; adoption of principles} 
the Act of Chapultepec in a 
Dumbarton Oaks set-up; a simple} 
majority vote in any security coun-| 
cil; the “right of unrestricted dis-| 
cussion and initiative’ on prob-| 
lems of world peace, and a “clear 
definition of aggression.” 

Relies on Latin America 


While Foreign Commissar Molo-| 
toff, chairman of the Soviet dele- 
gation at San Francisco, pressed| 





nf 


for an invitation to the Lublin Gov-| 
ernment, apparently hopeful that 
the three Latin-American votes on} 
t executive committee would fall| 

to line in return for Russian sup-| 
port of the Latins’ demand for an 
invitation to Argentina, an Amer- 
ican labor leader held a press con- 
ference at which he made public a} 
radiogram, purportedly from Polish} 
labor unions, which held that the 
Lublin Government was “demo-| 
cratic’ and should be invited. 

The press conference was held by} 
Leo Krzycki, vice president of the 
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of | 
America and head of the American 
Slav Congress, and the American 
Polish Labor Council. He said he 
did not know the two men who! 
signed the message from workers 
inside Poland, but declared that} 
they claimed to speak for 500,000) 
Polish union members. 








Almost a Debating Session 


The meeting with Mr. Krzycki, | 
held at the Fairmont Hotel, head-| 
quarters of the United States del-| 
egation, became almost a debating 
session when correspondents con-| 
nected with newspapers support- 
ing the London Polish Government 
argued with spokesmen for the| 
Lublin government. | 

Mr. Krzycki declared that on the! 
basis of his message from the Pol-| 
ish workers he was the only one} 
present in San Francisco who could | 
speak for Poles in Poland. 

His radiogram, signed by the 
Council of Trade Unions of liber- 
ated Poland, said in part: 

“The Polish peasant or intel-| 
jectual will never tolerate that 
Poland slide down again into the} 
abyss in which we were plunged! 
before 1939. We have suffered a) 
great deal and now we are still 
living through a difficult period of} 
hardships and deprivations and/| 
that is why we will never allow re-| 
actionary forces to rule us. All 
over Europe and in our country, 
the government must be based on 
the toiling masses, that is to say,/| 
the government must be demo- | 
cratic. We now have such a gov-| 
ernment.” 

Mr. Krzycki had a radiogram 
dated in February from Poland 
signed by “Dolinski” and “Wi- 
tasewski”’ which authorized him to 
represent the trade unions of lib- 
erated Poland and to use the funds 
released for this purpose which | 
were raised by American labor 
unions 


Disposal of CIO Fund 


An aide of Mr. Krzycki said that | 
the CIO had raised $300,000 for| 
Polish relief, half of which was 
turned over earlier to the exiled 
government in London. The funds 
referred to in the radiogram were 
the remaining $150,000, he said. | 

Mr. Krzycki declined to answer | 
such questions as io what of Po- 
land the London government rep- 
resented; whether exclusion of the 
Red Cross and foreign news corre- 
spondents from Poland did not in- 
dicate there was something to con- 
ceal; how the Polish people possi- 
bly could be represented by a 
President (Bierut) who a ques- 
tioner said was a Soviet citizen 
who had lived in Russia for fifteen 
years, or how Mr. Krzycki could 
be sure that the radiogram really 
came from representatives of 500,- 
000 Polish workers, as was claimed. 

To questions relating to the 
present Polish Government his} 
usual reply was that such matters 
were up to the Polish people, and 
not for him to decide. He denied 
that he represented, or had any 
connections with the Lublin Gov-

After Verbal Blast by Roosevelt 


By LAWRENCE E. DAVIES 
Special to Tue New York Times. 


SAN FRANCISCO, April 30— 
Having lest his fight in the Steer- 
ing Committee this morning 
against inviting Argentina to sit 
as a member of the United Nations 
Conference, Foreign Commissar 
Molotoff this afternoon carried his 
appeal to the world’s newspapers. 

Summoning correspondents to 
his second interview again on short 
notice, he confided to them that 
less than an hour later he would 
make an appeal to the full delega- 
tions of the forty-six participating 
| nations, at a plenary session. 

He put the United States Gov- 
ernment “on the spot” by quoting 
from statements made last fall by 
ppp Roosevelt and Secretary 
| Hull expressing concern over the 
| Fascist movement in Argentina. 
|Then he good-naturedly asked 
whether the South American coun- 
try in the meantime had swung 
over to a “democratic” govern- 
ment, and he suggested that a few 
days’ delay in voting an invitation 
to Argentina might gable this 
country to give the Soviet Union 
“accurate” information as to Ar- 
gentina’s status. 

Asked what steps were contem- 
plated by Moscow in the event a 
“documentation” of Argentina’s 
situation proved unsatisfactory to 
the Soviet Government, Mr. Molo- 
toff said it seemed to him that 
“the conclusions will be drawn in 
accordance with the documenta- 
tion.” 


Combs Fight on Argentina 


Combining his fight against in- 
viting Argentina to the confer- 
ence with his insistence on an in- 
vitation to the Polish-Warsawp Gov- 
ernment, the Soviet statesman in- 
timated that it might be “neces- 
sary” to “forget” Argentina, but 
asked why, if this were so, “must 
we forget the services rendered by 
Poland” in this war. He asked why 
“Poland and the Polish people 
should not be represented” re- 
gardiess of Argentina. 

Five or six hundred correspond- 
ents were in the colonial ballroom 
of the St. Francis’ Hotel when Mr. 
Molotoff, in gray business suit, 
walked in. He stood with an in- 
terpreter beside him during the 
His colleagues 
ranged themselves in chairs along- 
side him behind a long table. 

He told the newspaper and radio 
men that he was prompted to talk 
with them about Argentina be- 
cause the question was being wide- 
ly discussed and “our point of view 
is being presented in the newspa- 
pers, not always in the correct 
form.” He continued: 


“The Soviet delegation considers 


\the question of Argentina an im- 


portant one. Up to now the Soviet 
Government has had opportunity 
to discuss the question with the 
other governments, and if now this 
question is raised, the question of 
Argentina at the conference, it will 
be important to the Soviet Govern- 
ment, which is one of the four spon- 
soring governments. 
Quotes Roosevelt and Hull 


“As a matter of fact, Argentina 


|is a rather well-known country and 


its policy is widely known. I should 
like to cite an example of how out- 
standing leaders of the United 
States have appraised the policy 
pursued by Argentina.” 

Here, with evident relish, the 
Commissar read an account of a 
statement of former Secretary 
Hull, made last Sept. 7. 

“Secretary of State Hull yester- 
day,” he read, “branded Argentina 
as the headquarters of the Fascist 
movement in this hemisphere.” 

President Roosevelt, “a month 
later,” he said, told of “following 
closely and with concern” develop- 


;ments in Argentina, which, accord- 


ing to the quotation, presented an 
example of “Nazi-Fascist in- 
fluence” in this hemisphere. 

“I consider these statements 
very authoritative,” said the Com- 
missar with a smile, “and I am not 
going to add to these any state- 
ments made by Soviet leaders.” 

As he continued to hold the pa- 
pers from which he had been 
quoting, Mr. Molotoff, obviously 
delighted with the course of the 
interview, said that “perhaps since 


jlast October the Argentine Gov- 


ernment has been replaced by a 
democratic government.” 

The caustic quality of his tone 
was apparent as he added: 

“They know it much better in 
American, undoubtedly.” 

“But if this is so,” he went on, 
“we should like to be informed of 
these facts so that we will know 
it is an actual fact.” 

Mr. Molotoff told the press that 
if Argentina now was invited to 
the conference and Poland was not 
invited, “everybody will ask the 
question, ‘Does Poland hold a less 





KEARSARGE, CARRIER, 
TO BE LAUNCHED HERE 


Bearing a proud name in Ameri- 
the U. 8S. S. 
Kearsarge, 27,000-ton aircraft car- 
rier of the Essex class, will be 
launched next Saturday at the 
New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, 
it was announced yesterday by 
Rear Admiral Freeland A. Daubin, 
commandant of the yard. The 
launching will follow by six days 
the drydock launching of the 45,- 


|000-ton carrier Franklin D. Roose- 


velt there and thus will mark a 
climax to one of the most produc- 
tive weeks in the yard’s history. 

The Kearsarge will be the third 
of her type, the CV33, to be 
launched at the yard since- Pearl 
Harbor. Previous yard-built Essex 
class carriers were the Bennington 
and the Bon Homme Richard. The 
Kearsarge will be the eighteenth 
of her class to be launched. Her 
keel was laid on March 1, 1944. 
Her total launching weight will be 
24,300 tons. She is 856 feet long, 
with a 110-foot beam and will be 
equipped for a complement of 
about eighty airplanes. 

Ralph A. Bard, Under-Secretary 
of the Navy, will make the prin- 
cipal address. Mrs. Aubrey W. 
Fitch, wife of Vice Admiral Fitch, 
Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
(Air), will be the sponsor. Her 


important place among the nations 
than Argentina?” 

“I shall not mention the hero- 
ism of the Polish people and their 
sacrifices against the common foe. 
You know it too well. But no one 
can have any doubt that the pres- 
ent Polish Government now func- 
tioning in liberated Poland is a 
democratic Government, and this 
Government is anxious to have 
friendly relations with all of the 
United Nations. 

“The prestige of the Polish Pro- 
visional Government in their coun- 
try is growing day to day.” 

Mr. Molotoff predicted that 
there might be objections raised 
“to the fact that it may be neces- 
so~y to implement the Crimea de-} 
cision on Poland and then the 
Polish Provisional Government ma 
be invited to attend the confer- 
ence.” 

“I should like,” he said, “‘to re- 
ply to that question of the Polish 
Government, the question of reor- 
ganizing it on a Democratic basis 
should be left to the three Govern- 
ments which undertook to settle 
it in the Crimea.” 

He asserted that “all of us” be- 
lieved the question of reorganizing 
the Polish Government would be 
“settled shortly in a satisfactory 
manner” but added that “what 
matters to us is the representation 
of Poland at the conference.” 


Wants Bid Postponed 


As to Argentina, he said Soviet 
Russia was requesting only that 
“this invit* tion be postponed a few 
days and all the members of the 
conference be given time to study 
the question. 

“I do not think,” he protested, 
“that this request of the Soviet 
Government is too complicated 
and I do not think we should hur- 
ry %.” 

He was asked whether, on the 
Polish question, there were diffi- 
culties between his Government on 
one side and America and Britain 
on the other, and whether Warsaw 
would have final veto power on 
any decision. He replied: 

“Each one of the three Govern- 
ments is taking a very keen inter- 
est in Poland and view the ques- 
tion very seriously. But you ask 
whether the Polish Provisional 
Government has the right of veto 
over the United States, Great Brit- 
ain and the Soviet Union. I respect 
very highly the Polish Provisional 
Government in Warsaw, but if I 
respected them even more I should 
reiterate that no foreign Govern- 
ment has the right of veto.” 

To another query, he replied he 
had no doubt that representatives 
of the Peasant party and the So- 
cialist party of Poland would be 
added to the Provisional Govern- 
ment when it was re-formed. He 
added: “At any rate it will be re- 
organized, re-formed and strength- 
ened.” 


Queried on Yalta Pact 


Asked whether there was a dif- 
ference of opinion as to the inter- 
pretation of the Yalta Agreement 
on Poland, he retorted that “if 
there had been no question rela- 
tive to the Polish situation there 
would have been no use taking the 
Crimea decision,” and there would 
have been no need for the tri- 
country commission to deal with 
the matter. 

“It is clear that there are ques- 
tions which ought to be cleared 
up,” he said, adding: “Now permit 
me to depart for the plenary ses- 
sion.” 

At the outset of the interview, 
Mr. Molotoff said that at a world 
labor meeting in London, the So- 
viet representatives had sought to 
make it possible for a representa- 
tive of the world organization to be 
sent to the United Nations confer- 
ence “with an advisory vote.” 

“Inasmuch as it was said it 
would be difficult to comply with 
this request,” he added, “the Soviet 
delegate did not press for a vote 
on this question.” 

He said, however, that the United 
Nations conference would be at- 
tended “by a representative of the 
International Labor Organization 
in the capacity of adviser.” 

A reporter asked whether this 
had the approval of the American 
Federation of Labor, which at- 
tended the London meeting. 

“T have not asked the A. F. 
of L.,” Mr. Molotoff replied amid 
laughter. 

He said that the World Labor 
Group, now meeting in Oakland, 
Calif., to draft its international 
constitution and keep an eye on 
the San Francisco developments, 
“will receive an invitation to send 
its proposals to the conference.” 

“I think that’s a good thing,” 
he added. 


matron of honor will be Mrs. Don- 
ald W. Hamilton Jr. and her maids 
of honor will be the Misses Diane 
and Cynthia Gates, daughters of 
Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Sec- 
retary of the Navy for Air. 

The Kearsarge is the third ship 
in our Navy to have the name. 
The first was a steam sloop of war 
that sank the Confederate cruiser 
Alabama off France in 1864 and 
was wrecked off Central America 
in 1894. The second Kearsarge op- 
erated with the Battle Fleet in the 
first World War and was the only 
American battleship not named for 
a State. She was named because 
of the fame of the first Kearsarge 
and in 1921 became the Navy’s 
Crane Ship No. 1. She is still the 
largest sea-going crane in the 
Navy and, known officially as an 
auxiliary crane ship, is at Mare 
Island Navy Yard in California.

him from gaining this point, there 
is some apprehension tonight in 
our own delegation that, by back- 
ing the Argentine in this case, the 
United States has detracted from 
its ability to argue for moral prin- 
ciples in the forthcoming negotia- 
tions with the Russians on the 
Dumbarton Oaks amendments. 

There was no trouble over invit- 
ing the two Soviet Republics. The 
United States and Britain carried 
out their Yalta pledge on this sub- 
ject to the letter. And they went 
further. On the theory that ex- 
peditious fulfillment of the Yalta 
pledge might persuade the Russians 
to accept Argentina and shelve the 
difficult Warsaw Polish question, 
they urged and helped arrange the 
unanimous i nvitation to White 
Russia and the Ukraine. 

But the strategy did not work. | 
As soon as the executive commit-| 
tee had recommended the invita- 
tion for White Russia and the 
Ukraine, and the Mexican Foreign 
Minister, Ezequiel Padilla, had 


Argentina had played a very im- 
portant role in the war—in sup- 
port of our enemies. He quoted 
from the statement made by for- 
mer Secretary of State Cordell 
Hull on Dec. 7, 1944, that Argen- 
tina was fascist headquarters in 
this hemisphere and he quoted 
similar sentiments voiced by the 
late President Roosevelt on Oct. 1, 
1944. 

This was pretty good evidence, 
Mr. Molotoff declared, and he 


would not contribute any evidence 
of his own. It was true, he ad- 


;mitted, that these statements had 


been made some time ago and he 


had been told that some changes} 


had been made, but personally he 
thought it was only wise to hold 
up the invitation while the con- 
ference studied the evidence on 
how far the changes had gone. 

He asked what would happen 
if the conference invited the Ar- 
gentine “which helped the enemy 
throughout the war” and did not 
invite the Warsaw Polish Govern- 
ment, which, he said, represented 
one of our stanchest allies and 
which was a “democratic Govern- 
ment” that enjoyed “enormous 
prestige.” 


Question of Jurisdiction 


Mr. Molotoff sought to argue 
that the settlement of the Polish 
Government question was one for 
the Big Three powers which had 
met at the Crimea conference and 
was not a question for the present 
conference. 

There were many 


in keeping with

Says Problems Facing Dele- 





gates Are ‘Not Insurmount-

Yakov Viktorov, writer on for-| 
eign affairs for Pravda, Commu- 
nist party newspaper in Russia, as- 
serted that the difficulties con- 
fronting delegates to the United 
Nations Conference on Interna- 
tional Organization at San Fran- 
cisco were “not insurmountable,” 
jand that these difficulties “only 
discourage those who want to be 
discouraged,” the Moscow radio 
said in a broadcast recorded yes- 
terday by the Federal Communica- 
tions Commission. 

The broadcast, beamed in Hun- 
garian to Europe, said that he 
stressed the “great responsibility 
in the preservation of peace” 
borne by the “powers that carried 
the brunt of the struggle against 
the aggressor” and added that 
jocher “freedom-loving nations must 
|turn their backs in those who, un- 
der the pretext of the interests of 
small nations, try to create dis- 
sension among the great powers.” 

Touching on the admittance to 
the United Nations Assembly of 
the Ukraine and White Russia, the 
writer said, according to the 
broadcast, that the request to ad- 
j|mit the two Russian republics was

moved that Argentina also be in- 
vited, Mr. Molotoff objected. 

He pressed his objections. He 
argued that if the Polish Govern- 
ment in Warsaw was rejected by 
the conference because it was not 
representative of the people, then 
the Farrell-Peron Government of 
Argentina should be rejected for 
the same reason. Similarily, he 
contended, if the personnel and 
policies of the Argentina Govern- 
ment were not to be considered 
relevant to inviting Argentina, 
these sarne considerations should 
not be used to keep the Warsaw 
Poles out of the conference. 


Pleas for Argentina 


The Latin-American Foreign 
Ministers argued the case from a 
different premise. So did Mr. Stet- 
tinius and Mr. Eden. On Argen- 
tina’s part they said that the Mex- 
ico City conference last month had 
passed a resolution inviting the 
Argentine Government to take cer- 
tain actions that would put the 
Farrell-Peron Government in posi- 
tion to adhere to the declaration 
by the United Nations. 

The American nations, they said, 
had asked for a declaration of war, | 
for adherence to the principles of 
the Atlantic Charter, for specific 
war and post-war policies against 
Axis agents, against Axis commer- | 
cial firms, against Axis war crim- 
inals. The Argentine Government, 
the American Foreign Secretaries 
argued, had fulfilled these requests | 
and, therefore, we had a moral ob- 
ligation to invite her now to attend 
the conference. 

Furthermore, Mr. Eden and Mr. 
Stettinius argued, the question of 
inviting the Warsaw Poles was a 
separate question. The real point 





at issue, they contended, was not, 
as Mr. Molotoff had argued, wheth- 
er the Warsaw Poles were repre- 
sentative, but whether the Yalta 
agreement about creating a new 
Polish government of national 
unity had been fulfilled. In the 
American and British opinion, it 
had not, and therefore, until it had, 
the Warsaw Poles could not be in- 
vited. 

This committee meeting, due to 
end at 10:30, lasted until after 11 
o’clock, when the vote was finally 
taken on the invitation to Argen- 
tina, and the Russians were beaten, 
9 to 3. 

Mr. Molotoff, however, had only 
started. 


Battle in Steering Session 


The steering committee, com- 
posed of the heads of all the forty- 
six delegations, met at 11:30 and 
again the White Russians and the 
Ukrainians were brought in with- 
out a word of protest. Then Mr. 
Molotoff went all over the same 
argument concerning Argentina 





and the Polish issue, although he 
carefully avoided ever offering a 
motion in favor of inviting the 
Warsaw Poles. 

This meeting went on until after 
1 in the afternoon, Mr. Molotoff 
attacking the motion, with occa- 
sional support by the Czechs, the 
Yugoslavs, the Greeks, and the New 
Zealanders, who also made clear 
that they did not believe the Far- 
rell-Peron regime had been able to 
put away its totalitarian habits so 
quickly. 

Again, however, Mr. Molotoff 
was beaten, this time by 29 to 
6, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, 
Greece, Belgiurn and New Zealand 
voting with him and eleven na- 
tions abstaining, but again he 
pressed his case. 

A call went out at onee for the 
reporters. Mr. Molotoff would see 
them at his hotel at 2:45, and 
there, with more than 400 report- 
ers jammed into the ballroom and 
his tireless interpreter, Pavlov, at 
his side, he proceeded to go over 
all these arguments once more. 

This went on until nearly 3:30, 
when Mr. Molotoff broke it up and 
drove to the Opera House for the 
plenary session. Many things were 
said apout Mr. Molotoff during all 
this, but nobody contended that he 
was inconsistent, for when Mr. 
Eden, correct in his Saville Row 
clothes, asked if there were ob- 
jections to the committee recom- 
mendations that Argentina should 
be invited, Mr. Molotoff, wearing 
a brown suit and red tie, rose and 
strode to the sky-blue modern 
stage. 


Cites Unity on Other Bids 


He spoke extemporaneously and 
in Russian. He said he realized 
not many of the delegates under- 
stood Russian, but he added with 
a smile that it was a good lan- 
guage “for a just cause.” 

He then developed his argu- 
ment, first pointing out that the 
question at issue had not been dis- 
cussed before the conference, and 
then pointing out that in all other 
cases invitations to the conference 
had been agreed upon by all the 
four sponsor powers, the United 
States, Russia, Great Britain and 
China. 

Everybody knew, he said, that 


justified because of the “great part 
played by these republics in the 
struggle against Hitler.” 

“The lesson of war,” he contin- 
ued, “is that only the accord and 
unity of the great Allies guarantee 


case. Argentina represented one,}| 
he suggested, and there were the 
cases of India and the Philippines, | 
neither of which was independent. | 
The implication of this line of 





argument was that the Russians 
had agreed to inviting India and) 
the Philippines and that London 
and Washington should therefore 
agree to invite the Warsaw Poles.| 

The Foreign Ministers of Colom- 
bia, Mexico and Peru followed Mr. 
Molotoff to the stage and argued 
for Argentine admission. FEuro- 


the freedom, independence and se- 
curity of small nations against 
Fascism. 

“Freedom-loving small nations 
are afraid, not of freedom-loving 
great powers, but of the aggressor. 
This defines the main task as the 


delays mean that it is now too late 
to establish an international crimi- 


nal court by treaty. But it would| 
be a disaster of the first magni-|R= 
tude if trials for the major crimi-|& 


nals 


tion.” 


“The Foreign Secretaries are to-|= 


gether now in San Francisco,” he 
said. “It is 





peans who joined in the debate, it 
was noteworthy, tended to side 
with the Russians and against 
Argentina. The Belgian Foreign 
Minister, Paul Henri Spaak, said 
that all Mr. Molotoff was asking 
was a postponement of the decision 
and that this seemea to him to be 
eminently fair. 

The French indicated their de- 
sire to stay sitting on the fence in 
this continuing controversy among 
the Big Three by asking how to de- 
note their desire to abstain from 
voting, Mr. Eden, in the chair, told 
them to remain seated. When the 





1271 Broadway, at 


jvote came they did. 


What has disturbed the top dele- 
gates here is the combination of 
this protracted controversy and the 


|growing evidence that Mr. Molotoff 


will probably be leaving next week. 
This was the fifth day of the con- 
ference. So far, outside of an ex- 
change of views on amendments 
among representatives of the Big 


|Four yesterday, there has not been 


even any detailed study, let alone 
negotiation, on the Dumbarton 
Oaks amendments among the spon- 
sor powers. 

The hope of the American and 
British delegations had been that 
they would be able to get agree- 
ment with the Russians on Big 
Four amendments, at least, before 
Mr. Molotoff left, but it is possible 
that the commissions and subcom- 
mittees to be formally named to- 
morrow will not start working 
until Wednesday. 

The last part of the week ia, 
therefore, extremely important, for, 
after Mr. Molotoff leaves, it is 
feared that the work of negotiating 
the technical details of the charter 
will go even slower.

The

Samuel I. Rosenman has sub- 
mitted his report to President 
Truman on the matter of civilian 
supplies for the liberated areas of 
northwest Europe. The report is 
the result of a mission to these 
countries, on which he was re- 
cently sent by the late President 
Roosevelt. 

Pursuant to the direction of the 
President—who is very sympa- 
thetic with the needs of the lib- 
erated countries—Judge Rosen- 
man has discussed, and is now 
discussing the question with the 
Government agencies concerned 
in the matter, with the view of 
seeing to what extent, if any, 
these needs can be met. 

The President has authorized 
the release of the following sum- 
mary of the highlights of the re- 
port: 


SUMMARY OF REPORT 


1, The immediate and long-range 
economic situations of these lib- 
erated countries are extremely 
serious. The needs vary from 


| country to country. 


Seven million displaced persons, 
brought into Germany from over- 
run countries as slave labor, will 
increase its seriousness. These 
people have no source of food of 
their own, and will place a criti- 
cal burden upon an already se- 
verely limited food supply. 

Except in the rural, food-rais- 
ing areas, a dangerously low level 
of nutrition generally exists; coal 
production meets not even mini- 
mum requirements; ports have 
suffered great damage by bomb- 
ing and demolition. 

Railroads, canals and highways 
have been wholly or partially de- 
stroyed; and what remains of the 
usable means of internal trans- 
portation have been largely de- 
voted to Allied military use. The 
resultant lack of adequate trans- 
port carries serious consequences. 

Physical destruction is greater 
than in the last war. Manufac- 


| turing is paralyzed by destruction 


or damage, lack of raw materials 


and inadequate plant mainte- 
nance, 


Stresses Effect on Economy 


The needs of northwest EKu- 
rope’s liberated areas are grave, 
not only from a humanitarian as- 
pect but because they involve in- 
ternal and international political 
considerations, The future per- 
manent peace of Europe depends 
largely upon restoration of the 
economy of these countries, in- 
cluding a reasonable standard of 
living and employment. United 
States economy, too, will be deep- 
ly affected unless northwest Bu- 
rope again resumes its place in 
the international exchange of 
goods and services. Furthermore, 
a chaotic and hungry Europe is 
not fertile ground in which stable, 
democratic and friendly govern- 
ments can be reared. 

3. A realistic appraisal of the 
situation would indicate that the 
responsibility for providing a sub- 
stantial share of most civilian 
supplies will rest on the United 
States. United States policy 
should dictate acceptance of this 
responsibility as far as possible. 

4. To be effective, the accept- 
ance of this responsibility as a® 
Government policy should be 
enunciated by the President him- 
self. The policy should be framed 
so as to assure that the supplies 
necessary to meet the minimum 
requirements of all liberated 
areas will be met as fully as the 
successful prosecution of military 
operations and the maintenance 
of our essential domestic economy 
will permit. 

5. Once this policy is enunciat- 
ed, a high level interdepart- 
mental committee should be main- 
tained to advocate and support 
the claims presented by the lib- 
erated countries, in order to in- 
sure that the policy is in fact con- 
tinuously carried out. 

6. The most immediate and ur- 
gent needs common to all north- 
west European countries are cer- 
tain types of food, coal, coal-min- 
ing equipment and the means of 
internal transportation. 

7. The available supply of many 
kinds of food is insufficient for 
minimum requirements. To meet 
the United States share of these 
needs, a re-examination of total 
requirements against our supplies 
should be made. Certain appro- 
priate steps should be taken to 
assure maximum production of 
food in the liberated areas. We 
should examine the situation of 
those countries liberated by the 
U. S. 8S. R. in eastern Europe in 
order to ascertain what food sur- 
pluses may be available there for 
the deficit areas of western Eu- 
rope. 


Coal an Important Key 


8. Coal is one of the most im- 
portant keys to economic recov- 
ery in northwest Europe. Meet- 
ing even minimum coal require- 
ments for a year or more after 
V-E Day will be impossible. Any 
material alleviation of this situa- 
tion would require maximum coal 
production in Germany. This, 
however, entails certain serious 
politieal decisions, because it 
would mean immediate shipment 
of coal mining supplies to Ger-

| Report to President Declares We Must Do 


Our Share in Rehabilitation Even Though 
Our Rations Are Reduced 


By LANSING WARREN 


Special to Tus New Yor Times. 


WASHINGTON, April 30 — The 


United States should supply a) 


“substantial share’’of civilian needs 
in Europe, Judge Samuel I. Rosen- 
man advised President Truman in 
a report made public tonight. Al- 
though this would “‘cut into the ra- 
tion of the American consumer,” 
he said that permanent peace in 
Europe depends on restoration of 
its economy. 

Mr. Rosenman also reported that 
the European economic situation is 
so serious as to entail a prompt 
decision on the use of forced Ger- 
man labor. 

Coal supplies are so diminished 
that the minimum requirements 
cannot be met for a year or more 
after V-E Day, Judge Rosenman 


reported, and to deal with it would | 


mean such serious political deci- 
sions as. the rehabilitation of the 


German mines, and use of forced! 


German labor where necessary. 
Sent by President Roosevelt 


Judge Rosenman was sent by| 
the late President Roosevelt to} 
prepare this report on civilian sup-| 


plies to the liberated areas of 
northwest Europe. 
it to President Truman who was 
stated to be “very smpathetic with 
the needs of the liberated coun- 
tries,” he was directed to consult 
on the question of meeting these 
needs with the Government agen- 
cies concerned. 

The report also raised the ques- 
tion of requiring the Germans to 
remove the explosive mines from 
the seas adjacent to France and 
Belgium and proposed removal 
from Germany for the use for lib- 
erated countries of movable goods 
which American Supreme Head- 
quarters does not need. This might 
imply the transfer of factory 
equipment as well as supplies, ac- 


cording to the plan that was re-| 


ported to have been proposed by 
Secretary of the Treasury Morgen- 
thau. 

William L, Green, President of 
the American Federation of Labor, 
who conferred with President Tru- 
man today, declared when he left 
the White House that the AFL 
would oppose the use of forced 
labor in principle. He said that the 
revelation of German atrocities 
had shocked American labor, but 
had not altered its position on this 
question. 

Judge Rosenmian’s report, which 
stresses the seriousness of the eco- 
nomic situation both in Germany 
and in liberated countries, urged 
a re-examination by the United 
States of total foreign require- 
ments against our supplies. He said 


many; rehabilitation of battle- 
damaged or demolished German 
mines; restoration of German 
transport facilities for miners 
and mining purposes; supply of 
adequate food, clothing and foot- 
wear for German miners; provi- 
sion of electric power to produce 
coal even if it entails rehabilita- 
tion of some part of local utili- 
ties, and the use of forced Ger- 
man labor where necessary. 
These political questions are not 
within the province of the mia- 
sion to answer. Failure to take 
the steps outlined, however, 
would place insurmountable limi- 
tations on the extraction of Ger- 
man coal for liberated countries. 
The United States should exam- 
ine the extent to which it can 
supply coal to Europe, especially 
during any period of easier ship- 
ping which may develop after 
V-E Day; for #he lack of coal is 
of gravest political and economic 
concern, 

9. There can be little economic 
rehabilitation until the internal 
transportation situation is im- 
proved. The liberated areas 
should be given prompt and high 
priorities for rolling stock, loco- 
motives, maintenance and re- 
pair shop supplies, and raw ma- 
terials for local production of 
railroad equipment. A survey to 
determine the availability of 
Army trucks after V-E Day, for 
transfer to these countries, should 
be made; also the possibility of 
reconditioning used trucks here 
and abroad should be explored. 

10. Port capacity and clearances 
are now sufficient so that they 
should not be regarded as re- 
strictions upon procurement by 
the national governments or upon 
the allocation of ships to them. 
The limiting factor in the imme- 
diate future is the shortage of 
supplies. Should shipping develop 
to a choke-point, the shipping 
position should be re-examined at 
the highvst level to insure maxi- 
mum allocation to the liberated 
areas, consistent, of course, with 
the successful prosecution of the

“United States economy,” he 
said, “would be deeply affected un- 
less northwest Europe again re- 
sumes its place in the international 
exchange of goods and services. 
Furthermore, a chaotic and hungry 
Europe is not fertile ground in 
which stable, democratic and 
friendly governments can be 
reared.” 


Political Decisions Listed 


Improvement of the coal situa- 
tion, it is stated, would entail such 
political decisions as immediate 
shipment of coal mining supplies 
to Germany, the rehabilitation of 
|\German mines, the restoration of 
|transport facilities to them and the 
fuse of forced German labor if 
necessary. 

The report urged a survey of 
|'Huropean food-producing possibili- 
ities, including an examination of 
what the Danube countries, re- 
jcently occupied by the Soviet 
armies, might be able to contrib- 
ute to meet the western Huropean 
deficit. 

“A realistic appraisal of the sit- 
uation would indicate that the re- 
sponsibility for providing a sub- 
stantial share of most civilian sup- 
plies,” said the report, “will rest 
on the United States.” 

The report urged the President 
to accept this responsibility as a 
Government policy. 








Allies. Full advantage should be 
taken of present allocations and 
any temporary ease of shipping 
shortly after V-E Day. 

11. To supplement the electric 
power in liberated areas, thus 
saving coal and transportation, 
we should seek increased exports 
of electricity from Germany. 

12. Petroleum is essential for 
economic rehabilitation, particu- 
larly for its use in transportation. 
SHEAF now handles petroleum 
imports, but the responsibility 
will ultimately revert to the gov- 
ernments of these areas. Plan- 
ning for the transition should be 
undertaken now. 

13. Highest level decisions must 
be made immediately regarding 
the use of German productive 
capacity, and the extent, if at all, 
to which it should be restored 
and operated for the benefit of 
liberated countries of northwest 
Europe. 

14. Interim reparations machin- 
ery should be established at once 
to handle the growing problem of 
removal for needed use in lib- 
erated countries the movable 
goods uncovered in Germany by 
Allied armies, which SHEAF 
does not need. It should be in- 
tegrated with the work of the 
Reparations Commission. 

15. Repatriation of displaced 
persons should be undertaken as 
speedily as possible. 


Asks Mine Removal by Reich 


16. As the land of France and 
Belgium, and the adjacent seas 
are filled with German mines, a 
complete restoration of agricul- 
ture, shipping and fishing is se- 
verely restricted. As part of the 
peace terms, Germany should he 
compelled to furniya the person- 
nel to remove these mines. 

17. The military has met the re- 
sponsibility placed on it for pro- 
viding sufficient civilian supplies 
in northwest European liberated 
countries to prevent disease and 
unrest, "It has done this job well, 
despite the limitations of ship- 
ping, harbors, supply and inland 
transportation. Military com-

LONDON, April 30 (®) — The

aware of the necessity of main- 
taining at least a minimum econ- 
omy in the path of their commu- 
nications. These countries will 
also serve as re-deployment bases 
The immediate 
requirements of these areas, how- 
ever, go beyond the bare necessi- 
ties called for by the military in 
the performance of its responsi- 
bility for civilian supplies. This 
responsibility should be terminat- 
ed as soon aa practicable 

18. It is a new concept that 
responsibility for the care of ci- 
villian populations and temporary 
Governmental administration is a 
necessary part of our Army’s mil- 
itary mission. Modern total war 
has brought the military into di- 
rect contact with the political and 
economic lives of the countries 
through which it passes and has 
demonstrated the soundness of 
this concept. 

19. To discharge successfully 
our responsibility in economic re- 
lations with the liberated coun- 
tries, our embassies should have 
the necessary personnel, ade- 
quately experienced and trained. 
In this period of emergency, it 
will be necessary to supplement 
the trained manpower of the for- 
eign service 


Break-Up of Responsibilities 


20. The largest responsibility in 
dealing with economic problems 
fn the field falls upon the State 
Department and the FEA. In all 
cases, the senior economic officer 
in each embassy should be the 
joint designee of these agencies, 
as in Paris and Brussels, where 
it has proved to be a sound ar- 
rangement. 

21. The present liberated areas 
committee should be designated 
as the advocate of the claimant 
countries, referred to in Section 
V. At present, it is under the 
chairmanship of an _ Assistant 
Secretary of State, with compar- 
able membership of ,FEA, Treas- 
ury, War and Navy Departments. 
It is essential that the level of 
original membership be main- 
tained. It should have an out-

22. The Washington machinery 
for allocating supplies to liber- 
ated areas should be simplified 
and streamlined, The President 
should designate someone to ex 
amine this machinery and to rec- 
ommend changes designed to 
eliminate the complexities which 
now exist. 

23. UNRRA’'s supply activities 
northwest Europe are com 
unimportant, In the 
problem of displaced persons, 
however, UNRRA should be en- 
couraged to greater participation 
compatible with military neces- 
sities and the liberated countries 
own decisions. UNRRA's needs 
will increase. It ia essential, 
therefore, that it be given appro- 
priate consideration for supplies, 
transport and ocean shipping. 


Organizations in Heipful Roles 


24. The European Economic 
Committee, European Central In- 
land Transport Organization, 
European Coal Organization and 
United Maritime Authority, if 
created and thereafter supported, 
can perform helpful roles. The 
State Department, fully aware of 
their possible contribution, is fol- 
lowing their development closely 
with the purpose of expediting 
their establishment on a basis ac- 
ceptable to the countries most 
directly concerned. 

25. Discussions with the Gov- 
ernments of the liberated coun- 
tries relating to financial assist- 
ance for rehabilitation and re- 
construction should be under- 
taken several months hence. 
These countries are not yet ready 
for such discussions. In the 
meantime, data are being as- 
sembled on the extent of destruc- 
tion, cost of reconstruction and 
available foreign assets. Sub- 
stantial benefit will come from 
the passage of Bretton Woods 
legislation, repeal of the Johnson 
act and the amendments relat- 
ing to the Export-Import Bank. 
Facilities for credits to the lib- 
erated countries should be es- 
tablished at the earliest possible 
date. 

26. Since allocation of civilian 
supplies to liberated countries, 
in all probability, will cut into the 
ration of the American consumer, 
a widespread official and public 
campaign should be undertaken 
to inform the American people of 
the gravity of the needs of our 
Allies in liberated Europe. 

Conversely, there is no ade- 
quate understanding by the ordi- 
nary civilians in these liberated 
areas of what the Americans and 
British have done for the civil- 
ian population of these countries. 
Nor do they realize that in the 
United States, too, there are 
grave shortages. We should im- 
prove the transmission abroad of 
the story of the American war 
effort and of American sacrifices 
to improve the lot of our Allies.

April Second Warmest 
In Weather Records Here 


The Weather «Bureau  dis- 
proved yesterday with figures 
the complaint of many persons 
that April has been an unusual- 
ly cool month. As a matter of 
fact, with an average tempera- 
| ture of 55.2 degrees, it has been 
| the second warmest April ever 
recorded by the local bureau, 
Benjamin Parry, principal mete- 
orologist in charge, said. The 
average for April, 1941, was 56 
degrees and the normal average 
is 49.4. 

The highest temperature reg- 
istered was 81 on April 14 and 
the lowest was 36 on April 6. 

Temperature records for cer- 
tain days were broken on April 
3 and April 13, and the average 
for April 13 broke the record 
with 68 degrees. 

The total precipitation up to 
ior April 13 broke the record 
.23 inch below normal. The heav- 
iest rains were April 15 and 26, 
when 1.57 inches fell.

YOUNGEST PRODUCER 


SUIT OF RYAN HEIRS 
DISMISSED IN PART 


Surrogate Withholds Ruling 
Only on Sale of Ordnance 
Stock in the Estate 


Surrogate James A. Foley after 
a four-day hearing dismissed vir- 
tually all of the objections filed by 
the heirs of Thomas Fortune Ryan 
to an estate accounting by the 
Guaranty Trust Company, in 
which the financier’s grandchildren 
accused the executor of disposing 
assets at prices “inadequate and) 
below actual value.” 

The Surrogate overruled the ob- 
jections by Joseph B. Ryan and 
others who charged that the sale 
of 53,817 shares of Clinchfield 
Coal Company for $269,085 and 
1,500 shares of Clinchfield Fuel 
Company for $1,500 had been made 
“negligently, improvidently, im-

held that there was no such evid-/he isn’t preoccupied as a manager, 


ence, that the objections were un- 
supported by “evidence or law,” 
and that there was “no basis for 
surcharges.” 

The Surrogate also dismissed the 
objections to the payment of a 
$20,000 commission to K. H. 
Rockey in connection with the sale 
of the stock and to the payment 
of $4,425 expenses incurred by the 
sale of the assets. 

The objectors asserted that the} 
stock should have been sold at 
about $27 a share. They also ob-| 
jected to the sale of 18,505 shares 
of Auto Ordnance Corporation in 
July, 1939, with promissory notes 
for $1,090,000, sold for $529,000, 
which was $31,711 above the in- 
ventory value. 

In withholding his decision on 
the latter sale, Surrogate Foley 
said: “I did not see any evidence 
in the record to establish an im- 
provident sale as of March 21-23, 
1939.” He indicated that he would 
have ruled on this objection but} 
for a “highly technical question” 
in connection with the contract for 
the sale of the property. 

When all the evidence had been 
taken Theodore Kiendl, counsel for 
the trust company, moved to dis- 
miss on the ground that all of ‘the 
objectors had “failed to sustain 
the burden of proving any negli- 
gence or want of prudence on the 
part of the executor, and that the 
evidence overwhelmingly estab- 
lished the contrary.” 

In rejecting this motion, Surro- 
gate Foley ruled that he would 
dismiss the objection to the Clinch- 
field Coal stock but that he would 
withhold his ruling on the ordnance 
stock sale so as to permit Mr. 
Tuttle to file a brief by May 10.

MOSS SETS PENALTY 
ON STRAND THEATRE 


Rev entinn that City License Com- 
missioner Paul Moss has, ordered 
Warner Brothers’ Strand Theatre 
at Broadway and Forty-seventh 
Street not to open for business to- 
day and tomorrow until 3:05 P. M., 
the theatre management last night 
branded this penalty, imposed for 
selling a ticket to a minor, “un- 
warranted” for such an “accidental 
and technical violation.” 

The theatre normally opens at 
9:30 A. M. and the order thus 
means, roughly, a ten-hour penalty. 

The management said that it 
would display in its lobby, during 
the hours of enforced closing, a 
notice to the effect that this is “an 
arbitrary penalty imposed by Com- 
missioner Moss after he found an 
accidental violation of the law con- 
cerning admitting minors to thea- 
tres.”’ In a statement, the theatre 
management said it was admitted 
at the hearing before the Depart- 
ment of Licenses that the youth 
involved “appeared older than draft 
age.” It added that it had hitherto 
“always successfully eliminated 
from its ticket line children obvi- 
ously under 16 years of age.” 

Commissioner Moss was 
reached last night for comment.

(OF OVERTONS’ BRTONS'PRIZE 


Takes $1,000 War Bond for 
His Title ‘Married Alive’— 
Other Victors Announced 


By SAM ZOLOTOW 


Paul Czinner finds himself in a 
pleasant, albeit odd situation. Be- 
fore trade for ‘The Overtons” 
perked up he thought it would be 
a good idea to hold a title contest 
in order to focus attention on the 
Vincent Lawrence comedy. Yester- 
day the producer announced the 
winning label, though he doesn’t 
need it as a substitute. Of all peo- 
ple, who should turn up as the 


| 


S. Kaufman for his entry of ‘“Mar- 
ried Alive,” which will bring him a 
war bond of $1,000. 

Why the master should partici-| 
| pate in a title contest at this stage | 
of the game is explained by the 
following incident: Arlene Francis, 
who is appearing in the comedy, 
told him about the contest and he 
suggested that “Married Alive” 
was his choice. 
submit it and she did. 

Second and third prizes of $500 
and $100 war bonds, respectively, 
went to Jeanne Turner for ‘“Some- 
thing Called Human Nature” and 
to Mrs. Edward Hoyt for “Laugh 
With the Gods.” 


Another vacation is looming for 
the entire cast of three players in 
“The Voice of the Turtle,” now in 
its second year on Broadway. For 
eight weeks (July 2-Aug. 25, in- 
clusive) Elliott Nugent, Betty 
Field and Audrey Christie will he 
enjoying a holiday. The box office, 
however, will remain open for busi- 
ness. Last summer the engage- 
ment was suspended for nine 
weeks, one of which was devoted 
to six free performances for mem- 
bers of the armed forces 

As previously indicated, three 
other shows are eagerly awaiting 
rest periods: “Hats Off to Ice’ 
(May 7-29), “The Late George Ap- 
ley” (July 2-28), “A Bell for 
Adano” (July 2-Aug. 11). During 
the hiatus the box-office staff of| 
each will be on hand for custom-| 
ers. 








Gold Is Where You Find Ft 


In April of last year John Gold- 
len and Harry Joe Brown joined | 
|hands to produce “But Not Good-| 
bye.” Richard Whorf handled the 
direction for the George Seaton 
comedy, in which Harry Carey, 
Elizabeth Patterson, 
and John Conway appeared. After 
twenty-three performances it was 
taken off, but not forgotten. The 
other day the screen rights were 
picked up by Metro for $20,000. 








Since St. Patrick’s Day of 1943 | 


“Kiss and Tell’ has been passing 
various milestones. Tonight the F. 
Hugh Herbert comedy (second old- 


est of the current shows) chalks|

Question for Mr. Delmar 


When Harry Delmar returns here 
today or tomorrow from the Coast, | 
a statement on the status of the | 
musical comedy script, “Holiday 
for Girls,” will be sought from him 
by the authors. Mr. Delmar holds 
an option until August. It is quite 
possible that Al Borde and Emil 
Friedlander, who were originally 
slated to produce the musical with | 
Mr. Delmar, might put it on them- 
selves as soon as the go ahead sig- 
nal is given, 








Henceforth the 
‘Common Ground” 
Sunday 
and

schedule of 
will include 
performances — matinee 
evening. Beginning next

Wednesday matinee showings will 
be dropped. Sunday perform- 
ances of ‘‘Ten Little Indians” have 
been discontinued. Next week the 
thriller will revert to the regular 
schedule—Monday through Satur- 
day night, with matinees on 
Wednesday and Saturday. 


Newly added to “Oh, Brother!” 
co-starring Hugh Herbert and Ar- 
leen Whelan, are sorrest Orr and| 
Susana Garnett. 

Blanche Yurka 
for “The Wind Is Ninety’; Joyce 
Van Patten and Frances Reid have 
been engaged 

Appearing in Fred Stone’s sup- 
porting company of “You Can’t 
Take It With You,” opening to- 
night in Bridgeport, will be Judith) 
Abbott and Geraldine Stroock, | 
daughters of George Abbott and 
sig te Stroock. 

A spokesman for Gene Lockhart 
called yesterday to say that the| 
actor had decided not to appear 
in “Devils Galore,” now owned by 
William Cahn. 

This Week's Equity Library} 
Theatre Offerings: “Hamlet” at 
the George Bruch Branch, tonight 
through Friday, with a matinee on 
Friday; “The Late Christopher) 
Bean” at the Hudson Park Branch, | 
tonight through Thursday. 





‘Common Ground’ Forum Planned 

A forum-discussion will follow 
oe night's performance of | 
| “Common Ground,” at the Fulton| 
Theatre, it has been announced by}

Rookie Southpaw to Get First 
Start Against the Braves— 
Giants in Philadelphia 


By LOUIS EFFRAT 

Another Blue Monday passed| 
yeste and the major league| 
clubs will resume firing this after- 
noon and tonight. The date will) 
be notable if only because the ini-| 
tial night game of the campaign is| 
to be contested.under the Sports-| 
man’s Park lights at St. Louis, | 
where the Browns will be host to} 
the Indians. This will be the first| 
of forty-three arc-light engage-| 
ments the Browns will play at 
year. 
However, of greater local inter-| 
est at the moment is the return to} 
action of the Yankees, Giants and} 
Dodgers, the first and last-named| 
at | and Mel Ott’s men at| 
Philadelphia. The Yankees will| 
send Walter Dubie] to the mound 
against Russ Christopher and the 
Athletics at the Stadium, while at 
Ebbetts Field Leo Durocher will 
nominate his young southpaw, Vic 
Lombardi, for duty against Nate 
Andrews and the Braves. At Phil- 
adelphia Harry Feldman is to go 

against Charley Schanz.

Yost’s 74th Birthday Recalls 
Michigan F ootball of 1901-05 


Win Exhibition Pa by 3.6 Best Came First, Wolverine Teams of That 
Period Winning 55 of 57 Games, Witha 
Point Total of 2,821 Against 42 


for 750 Wounded Sailors— 
Entertain in Sick Bay 


An off day in the schedule gave 
\the Dodgers an opportunity to drop 
lin for a visit at St. Albans Naval 
|Hospital yesterday, where they en- 
itertained wounded men and per- 
sonnel with a baseball game and 
jalso toured the sick bay, signing 
autographs and chatting with the 
|men. It was a banner day for the 
lsailors, even though the Dodgers 
defeated the St. Albans nine, 8—6. 

The contest was played at Sher- 
wood Oval, a mile or so away from 
the hospital grounds. However, the 
Central Queens Chapter of the 
American Red Cross transported 
some 750 wounded men to the 
game and a fine time was had by 
lall. The Red Cross women handed 
out ice cream, peanuts, popcorn 
and soft drinks, too. 

To conquer the home team, 
which is coached by Al Campanis, 
Dodger farmhand, now a specialist 
first class, and shortstop for the 
Naval team, the Brooks were called 
upon for a last-inning rally. Against 
Dick Ames, erstwhile Columbia 
hurler, the Dodgers filled the bases 
with two out in the ninth and a 
single by Stan Andrews broke a 
6-all tie, chasing home John Doug- 
\las and Morrie Aderholt. 

Ray Hathaway opposed Ames 
and yielded four hits as compared 
to ten given up by Ames. 
Brooks were guilty of eight errors, 
one of which was charged to Augie 
Galan in the second, when Hatha- 
way fanned four men and retired 
another on an infield roller. Galan’s 
misplay occurred when Lloyd 
Bucy fanned and Clyde Sukeforth 
dropped the third strike. 

Bucy, seeing Sukeforth throw to 
Galan, stopped halfway up the 








By The United Press. 


The “old man” was 74 yesterday | 
and he’s still the sweetheart of| 
Sigma Chi. 

He'll be it, too, as long as Michi-| 
gan men talk Michigan football. | 

That’s Fielding H. Yost, who is| 
all to the Wolverines that Rockne 
is to Notre Dame, Stagg is to Chi- 
cago and Zuppke is to Illinois. 
That’s the grizzled man from the 
West Virginia hills with the mid- 
dle initial that stood for Harris 
but meant “Hurry Up” to every 
player who ever wore the maize 
and blue of tha Wolverines. 

The parade has passed him by, 
as far as football is concerned, but} 
the one-time farm boy from Fair-| 
view, W. Va., still is the famed} 
figure that he was when he retired | 
four years ago. Yost meant a lot) 
jat Michigan. But he was one of 
those figures no one school could 
claim. He meant too much to the} 
game that is football, to the thou-| 
sands who played it and the mil- 
lions who watched. 


“Borrowed” by Lafayette 


It was over a half century ago} 
when Yost first took to the game) 
las a student at West Virginia. The 
year was 1894 and he was so good | 
ithat Lafayette “borrowed” him to 


| 











The | play left tackle against Pennsyl-| Yost. 


lvania to break up the Quakers’} 
famed “guards back” play, then| 
the scourge of the gridiron. Lafa-| 
lyette won. And Yost went back| 
Ito get his law degree in 1897. 

The next season he was coach) 
at Ohio Wesleyan. Then came Ne-| 
braska, Kansas, Stanford and fi-| 
nally Michigan—and destiny. For} 
it was Yost who built the Wolver-| 


when, in five seasons, Yost-led 
elevens ground their way to fifty- 
five victories against one defeat 
and one tie. Figures are uninter- 
esting. But they hammer home a 
staggering point when you con- 
sider that in 1901 Michigan scored 
550 points to 0; in 1902, a total of

Never Forgot Top Five 


Those mauling Michigan teams 
during that period were the best 
five consecutive football teams any 
college ever moved into destructive 
action. There were a horde of big, 
fast, smashing backs, led by the 
incomparable Willie Heston, 190 
pounds of steel. In front of them 
was a speedy line that averaged 
215 pounds. They were great, and 
if you don’t believe it, take a month 
off and ask Yost. 

Hurry Up never forgot them. He 
never stopped talking about them. 
But as far as that goes Yost never 
ceased talking football. He was 
indefatigable on that subject. 
Someone asked Ring Lardner once 
whether he had ever’ spoken to 


“No,” Lardner replied. “My fa- 
ther taught me never to inter- 
rupt.” 

That was Fielding H. (Hurry 
Up) Yost, the hardy perennial 
who lived, dreamed and talked 
football for more than a half a 
century with all the enthusiasm of 
new fraternity brothers in his be- 
loved Sigma Chi. Lived, dreamed 


he is working up some steam about the Nelson- 
Snead seventy-two-hole match over two metro- 
politan courses on May 26 and 27. But before he 
got around to that subject he told of an incident 
which took place on the Coast a few years ago. 

John Black, a veteran professional, followed 
Nelson on one round, Snead on another and Ben 
Hogan on a third. He never said a word as he 
watched them, but puffed quietly on his pipe. 
Corcoran was curious as to Black’s reactions, but 
the unsmiling Briton was very noncommittal. He 
admitted that Snead was “fair” and that Nelson 
and Hogan also were just “fairly good golfers.” 

“How would you compare them to Vardon?” 
asked Freddie. That did it. 

Black exploded, his taciturnity gone. “It would 
be sacrilege to mention their names in the same 
breath with Vardon’s,” he said, biting hard on 
the stem of his pipe. ‘‘He could do anything with 
a golf ball. I once caddied for him and I'll never 
forget the time his ball landed in a stone quarry. 


It Wasn’t Luck 


“ ‘Boy,’ he said to me, ‘go to the top of the 
quarry and show me the line to the green.’ Then 
I handed him his cleek, pointed out the direction 
and got out of the way. As he hit the ball stones 
flew up, but that ball dropped within ten feet of 
the cup. When Harry made ready to putt, some 
unthinking spectator remarked, ‘What a lucky 
shot that was!’ Vardon never said a word as he 
putted out the hole. He took a dozen balls with 
him and went back into the quarry. He took 
twelve shots and those twelve balls formed a 
ring around the hole. That’s how good Vardon 
was.” 

With that Black stalked majestically away. 
That night the great Vardon was the center of 
discussion among the youthful golfers themselves, 
most of whom hadn't even been born when the 
Englishman ruled the links. Hogan sought out 
Victor East, another veteran professional. “Just 
how good was Vardon?” asked Ben. 

“He had one*terrific weakness,” answered the 
smiling pro. “He couldn’t play thirty-six holes 
in the same day over the same course. You see, 


He drove his usual straight and long one down 
the fairway. Just as he addressed the pellet he 
whistled softly in wonder. It had landed in the 
very divot he had made in his previous round. 

“Tl be darned,” drawled the grinning Texan. 
“I’ve landed in my own divot. Well, boys, I’ve 
equaled Vardon at long last.”

Dubiei Seeks Revenge 


So much for the pitching choices. 
The game at the Stadium will give| 
Dubiel an opportunity to gain re-| 
venge, for it was the Mackmen| 
who handed the Yankee right-| 
hander his first setback of the! 
season last week at Shibe Park.| 
That was the dismal afternoon 
when Dubiel failed to hold a 5-0} 
lead and the Athletics shelled him| 
from the firing line in the fourth, 
an which saw the home nine 
count all its seven runs, which pro- 
cuced a 7-5 victory 

There was, though, one untoward | 
which led to Dubiel’s| 
downfall that contest. For if 
Joe Buzas, the rookie shortstop, 
had come up with what appeared 
to be a double-play grounder the! 
Athletics would have been retired | 
without a run and Dubiel might} 
have gone all the way, instead of 
being relieved by Allen Gettel. 
Even though the official scorer at 
Philadelphia called it a hit, Buzas| 
blamed himself, insisting he should | 
have made the play cleanly 

On the whole, Yankee pitching 
has been commendable. Hank| 
Borowy, who recovered from a| 
faulty first inning against the Sen-| 
ators on Sunday, has won three} 
straight, and Atley Donald lost a 
tough decision to Washington.| 
Ernie Bonham has convinced all 
he is in shape and, all in all, the! 
impression is that the New York 
pitchers will do, thank you. Russ 
Derry and Nick Etten are poling} 
out the long ones and, along with| 
Johnny Lindell, the power appar-| 
ently is there. |

To Err Is Human 


Maybe the old-timers will choose Vardon and 
Ray over Nelson and Snead, but the younger 
generation will prefer the low-scoring modern 
wizards. Lord Byron is supposed to be one of the 
most mechanically perfect golfers the game has 
ever had, but even this scoring machine has 
moments when he displays human frailty. Cor- 
coran was telling of a missed putt which cost him 
a tie with Snead in the Los Angeles Open. 

The ball rested exactly—hold your hats on this 
one!—five inches from the cup. It was much too 
short a distance to bother lining up. So the lean 
Texan gave a most casual and indifferent swipe 
at the little white pill. And he never even touched 
it, the putter grazing over. the top for a most | 
expensive stroke. 

“That was the shortest stroke of our winter 
tour,” said the bustling Freddie. ‘Now I'll tell 
you about the longest one. We were at an air 
base in Tucson and we had a driving contest. 
Since it was on the macadam air strip runway, 
I figured that we'd set a distance record of some 
sort. Unfortunately, though, it had rained the 
night before and puddles slowed up the length of 
the drives. But we didn’t do badly. Craig Wood 
won with 365 yards, but that isn’t too surprising 
because he beat out Snead in the majority of our 
driving contests. 

“On a regular course Craig can hit them some- 
where between 260 and 280 yards, while Sammy 
never is very consistent. The model of consistency, 
of course, is Nelson. He’ll hit every drive an even 
250 yards and he’s so fiendishly accurate that 
each ball lands in almost the identical place. 

“Say, maybe there is something to that Vardon 
gag about landing in his own divots. Come to 
think of it, Byron Nelson does the same thing.”

Honorably discharged veterans 
hold key positions in the 1945 base- 
ball pennant races today, although 
the draft boards continue to take 
about eight men for every former 
athlete returned. 

Al Benton of the Tigers is one 
of the most conspicuous of the ex- 
service men able to step back int 
big league stride. The 32-year- 
Oklahoma righthander shut 
the Browns in his first start after 
receiving his Navy discharge and 
whipped Cleveland next. In eigh- 
teen innings Benton has allowed 
only six hits to take his place as a 
valuable complement to the pitch- 
ing team of Dizzy Trout and Hal

out of the Army in November and 
took control of the receiving job

Two Others Tie for Fourth 

Place With 67s—Large Field 
in Opening Tourney 


Fifty-four teams, including guest 
professionals from Westchester) 
and New Jersey, helped the Long | 
Island P. G. A. open its amateur-| 
pro tournament season at the! 


Fresh Meadow Club in Flushing 
yesterday and after a lengthy ses- 
sion in which some fine perform- 
ances were registered, three pairs 
finished in a deadlock for first 
place | 

Mike Turnesa, veteran pro from! 
Knollwood, was a member of two 
of the three top combinations. He| 
paired with Jack Horn, also of 
Knollwood, to post a 33-33—66 
and combined with Sid Levinsohn, 
Glen Oaks, to turn in a 34-32—66. 
Woodrow Long and Wiffy Cox, of 
Hempstead, were the other pair in 
the winning picture, also with 34- 
32. 66 

There also was a tie for fourth 
place, but only two combinations 
were involved. They were Leonard 
Zahn, Glen Oaks, and Turnesa and 
Levinsohn and Willie Goggin of 
Century. The former had a card of 
33-34—-67 while the Levinsohn- 
Goggin duo posted 35-32-—67. 

Following the first five pairs in 
the scoring came a quintet dead- 
locked with 68's. They were Ralph 
Strafaci, Hempstead, and Cox, with 
37-31-68; Jack Creavy, Mitchel 
Field, and Alex Watson, Leewood, 
and Zahn and Goggin, both with 
35-33-68; Frank Paley, Woodmere, 
and Fred Moore, Dunwoodie, with 
a pair of 34's, and Abe Fingerhut 
and Henry Ciuci of the home links 
with 33-35-68. 

Four others came under the 70 
mark with 69's. The two Ciucis, 
Dick and Henry, of Fresh Meadow, 
had 35-34-69. This total was dupli- 
cated by Horn and Goggin, with 
36-33-69; Dick Moraff and Mar- 
shall Trusttum, Preakness Hills, 
with 35-34-69 and Dale Scott, 
Plandome, and Henry Ciuci, with 
34-35-69.

Will Make Golf Balls \ASSRRTS Y-RAY ° 


SPORTS 


From Synthetic Rubber 


WASHINGTON, April 30 ( 
—Golf balls will soon return to 
production, by courtesy of the 
War Production Board. 

The WPB now is planning a 
revision of rubber regulations 
which would permit manufacture 
of new golf balls with neoprene 
synthetic rubber interiors. 

The covers are of balata, the 
gum rubber now used for “re- 
treading” old golf balls. 

W. James Sears, chairman of 
the WPB’s rubber requirements 
committee, acknowledged today 
that the release of neoprene was 
in prospect but said he could not 
estimate how many balls could 
be produced until the allocations 
were made. 

Reports came from manufac- 
turers that 5,000,000 would be 
produced, but Sears stated only 
that “reasonable quantities could 
be expected.”

WOOD, FIELD 


By JOHN 


If you had been at Shinnecock 
Bay on Sunday all you had to do to 
get all the weakfish you wanted 
was to pick them off the beach. 
Henry Altenkirch, backed by his 
sister Miriam, yesterday told how 
a school of weakfish was driven 
out of the water by sharks. The 
story appeared a bit hard to be- 
lieve, but the Altenkirches were 
emphatic about its truth. 

It seems that Sunday morning 
the sharks chased the weaks from 
the ocean through Shinnecock in- 
let into the bay, thence eastward 
to a hole from which the ebb tide 
later drained almost all the water. 
That left the fish stranded and the 
natives picked up all the fresh fish 
they wanted—pounds and pounds 
of it. A man named Ed Skinner got 
seventy-five pounds, others took 
more. By yesterday there wasn’t 
a fish left. 


Dead Sharks on Beach 


How Altenkirch knew that 
sharks had done the deed was that 
half a dozen of them left their own 
carcasses high and dry along with 
their intended victims. The sharks 
were five or six feet long. 

The beachcombers weren't the 
only ones to get weakfish in the 
bay 
them two unidentified soldiers, 
got them off the bottom from row- 
boats. The soldiers had eight be- 
tween them, ranging from a pound 


and a half to two and a half 
crew re- 


pounds. A commercial

Also making his move belatedly, 
C. U. Yeager’s Parasang took the

quarter over the early pace-setter, 
Mrs. J. B. Burnstein’s Okana. The

Newmarket Favorite Out 


LONDON, April 30 (Reuter)— 
Fred Darling, owner and trainer of 
Isle of Capri, 7-to-2 favorite for 
the One Thousand Guineas, to be 
run at Newmarket on May §8, 
stated today that the filly would 
not start in the first classic of the 
season. 

Last Saturday in the six-furlong 
Castle Plate, Isle of Capri finished 
a bad last behind four other horses. 
Her odds were 100 to 80. She faded 
after going five furlongs. 


Van Horn Keeps Titles 

PINEHURST, N. C., April 30 (®) 
—Tennis history repeated itself in 
the North and South professional 
tournament yesterday, as singles 
and doubles champions retained 
the titles they won last year. Wel- 
by Van Horn, Atlanta, triumphed 
over Richard Skeen of Palm Beach, 
Fla., in the singles, 8—6, 6—0, 
6—3, and then teamed up with 
Frank Rericha of Greenwich, 
Conn., to defeat Skeen and Ed 
Copeland, Rollins College tennis 
coach, 6—4, 8—6, 6—4. 


AND STREAM 


RENDEL 


Altenkirch believes rowboat 
fishermen are going to fare hand- 
somely with the weaks in Shinne- 
cock this season. He hasn’t heard 
of any taken from Peconic Bay yet. 
|It will be bottom fishing for these 
fighters until May 16, the first 
legal day for chumming with 
shrimp. 


White Perch at Hemlock 


Ralph Brady, Harry Newmark 
land Lou Haight took their limits 
lof white perch from Hemlock Res- 
ervoir Saturday and Sunday. The 
word had got around that the 
perch fishing was good in Hem- 
lock and there were a lot of fisher- 
men there trying for them, plus 
many who just watched. Hemlock 
be also reported to have produced 
a 13-pound brown trout one day 
last week, but the man who took it 
was keeping it to himself. About 
the same time John Kroell caught 
a 4%-pound rainbow from Lake 
Gleneida, using worms for bait. It 
was believed to be the biggest 
taken from the lake this season. 


The brook trout fishing at Still- 
water Lake in Clarence Fahnestock 
Memorial Park didn’t appear pro- 
al- 
though all the thirty-odd boats 
available were rented. Brady tried 
\it as well as Hemlock Saturday 
and Sunday. It was very cold 
Saturday and he got none. All he 
saw on Sunday between 8 A. M. 


ported to have netted more than ajand noon were three that were

WILL REDUCE JOBS 


Green Says Cut in Purchasing 
Power May Block Post-War 
Production Expansion 


Special to Tas New Yor Tres. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Wide- 
spread unemployment will prevail 
in the United States after V-E Day, 
but some of this unemployment 
will be offset as soon as reconver- 
sion measures develop a large de- 
mand for civilian goods, William 
Green, president of the American 
Federation of Labor, stated after 
a visit to President Truman today. 

Later the executive committee 
of the federation now meeting here 
issued this statement: 

“Unless the reconversion proc- 
ess is expedited, mass unemploy- 
ment will grip America in 1945 
and purchasing power will be re- 
duced to such a low point that 
expansion of post-war production 
will be blocked. 

The call upon President Truman 
was the first by Mr. Green since 
the former Vice President was in- 
augurated. 

As part of its quarterly meeting, 
the executive council said defeat 
of te manpower legislation had 
been proved justified. There was 
now, said the council, “no more 
talk of the need of forced labor.” 

Noting that cutbacks are al- 
ready beginning, the council fore- 
saw the end of the European war 
meaning that the war production 
program would be generally sliced 
in half within a few months. It 
was imperative, it added, that 
American industry be given ade- 
quate notice of war contract can- 
cellation so it could proceed with 
plans for peacetime production in 
order to provide jobs for displaced 
war workers and returning service 
men. 

The council advocated reviving 
a bill sponsored by President Tru- 
man, as a Senator, “providing far 
more adequate unemployment com- 


WLB ORDERS LEWIS 
10 KEEP MINES OPEN 


Continued From Page 1 


newed the request at yesterday’s 
conference, after which it was an- 
nounced by Mr. Lewis that there 
would be no work done in the 
anthracite mines of Pennsylvania 
today. The 72,000 anthracite 
miners voted last Thursday by an 
overwhelming majority to stop 
work in the event of failure to 
reach a new agreement by mid- 
night last night. 

The WLB order served on Mr. 
Lewis and the union last night, 
signed by Chairman George W. 
Taylor, said that it will be decided 
at today’s hearing before the 
board whether the board can act 
on the issues directly without the 
formalities of a special panel hear- 
ing. 

May Recommend Seizure 


It was considered likely that in 
the event-of the miners’ refusal to 
extend the present contract, the 
board would recommend seizure of 
the mines by the Government. 

Mr. Lewis’ announcement of 4 
stoppage in the anthracite fields 
beginning this morning, in accord- 
ance with the traditional principle 
of the miners not to work without 
a contract, was made after a meet- 
ing of the union’s tri-district scale 
committee at the Hotel Roosevelt 
after the miners’ joint meeting 
with the operators. Three hours 
later the WLB issued its order. 

Following the meeting of the 
scale committee Mr. Lewis issued 
this statement: 

“The tri-district scale committee 
of the miners, by unanimous vote, 
resolved that it would not request 
the men to return to work until the 
anthracite operators accepted the 
proposals of the Secretary of Labor 
for a new contract.” 

Miss Perkins took steps to have 
the dispute certified immediately 
to the National War Labor Board. 

Upon receipt of the WLB order 
last night Mr. Lewis had “no com- 
ment.” It was learned, however, 
that both the miners and opera- 
tors would be represented at to- 
day’s hearing before the board, but 
Mr. Lewis will not be present. The 
negotiating committees of the 
miners and operators had pre- 
viously made arrangements to con- 
tinue discussion in New York this 
morning. 

Miss Perkins’ Proposal 

The compromise proposal offered 
by Miss Perkins to the joint wage 
conference yesterday, as explained 
by her following the meeting, was 
predicated upon abandonment by 
the union of most of its thirty 
original demands, including the de- 
mands for a 25 per cent wage in- 
crease and a royalty of 10 cents 
a ton on all anthracite coal mined, 
the proceeds to be used by the un- 
ion for establishing a medical, 
hospitalization and social service 


fund. Miss Perkins explained that} 


Mr. Lewis and his associates 
agreed to accept in lieu of the un- 
ion’s original proposals the follow- 
ing compromise program: 

Payment by the operators of one 
hour of travel time, including pay 
for a fifteen-minute lunch period, 
on the basis of time and a half, 
totaling $1.50. 

Payment for overtime at the 
rate of time and a half after seven 
hours’ work instead of after an ac- 
cumulation of forty hours within 
any week. 

An increase in the present vaca- 
tion pay of $50 to $75. 

Payment of a 4-cents-an-hour 
premium for the second and 6 
cents for the third shift, instead of 
10 and 15 cents, respectively, as 
originally demanded by the miners. 

Conclusion of an agreement for 
one year. The union’s original pro- 
posal was that there be no limit to 
the new eontract, with the privi- 
lege of reopening it on twenty 
days’ notice. 


Some Demands “Too Drastic” 


Referring obviously to the 
union’s original demands for a 25 
per cent wage increase and a roy- 
alty of 10 cents a ton, Miss Per- 
kins said she believed ‘‘some of the 
demands were very drastic’ and 
“went too far,” and offered her 
compromise as a reasonable solu- 
tion of the dispute. 

This was not, however, the opin- 


Auto Tire Quota for May 
Set at Only a Million 


By The Associated Press 

WASHINGTON, April 30.— 
Only one million passenger tires, 
including motorcycle tires, will 
be available for rationing in May, 

the Office of Price Administra- 
tion said today. 

Demand for tires in May is al- 
ways considerably greater than 
in April, the OPA reminded. The 
April allocation for rationing 
was 3714 per cent below March. 

Some increases over April al- 
locations were granted in the 
truck and bus tire category and 
in the tractor-implement cate- 
gory, but OPA said heavier de- 
mand is expected to offset these 
increases. 

The May quota for larger sizes 
of truck and bus tires is 156,000, 
compared with 147,850 for April; 
for smaller truck and bus tires, 
314,000, compared with 266,700. 

The May quota for larger 
tractor-implement tires is 40,000 


and compared with 25,000 initial- | 


ly allocated for April, but subse- 
quently increased by a supple-

CHICAGO OPA PRIES_ | 
MEAT FROM LOCKERS 


CHICAGO, April 30 (®)—An| 
effort by the Office of Price Ad-| 
ministration to divert into regular | 
market channels thousands of| 
pounds of meat acquired without} 
points and row stored in frozen-| 
food locker plants began to pro- 
duce results, the agency reported | 
today. 

Marion W. Isbell, the OPA’s| 
area director, announced that} 
many patrons of the Dutch Dairy| 
frozen-food locker plant, which| 
was investigated by the agency) 
Friday, since had produced aseped, 
for the meat by bringing ration) 
books of friends and relatives] 


among whom they distributed the 
meat, while others arranged with| 
their butchers to issue ration bank | 
checks in exchange for the stored | 
cuts. He said that 5,000 red points | 


had been turned over to the OPA) 
by locker patrons in the last two) 
days. | 

The surprise visit to the plant 
was made by agents of the OPA in| 
a drive to determine how much| 
meat had been obtained without} 
exchanging red ration points. 

The investigators today planned | 
a conference with the operators of | 
twenty other frozen-food locker} 
plants to ask their cooperation on| 
putting meat acquired without 
points back into the retail market. | 

Of the 500 locker patrons ques- 
tioned to date by the OPA agents, | 
more than 80 per cent were unable} 
to surrender ration points for their 
meat. Nor were they able to pro-| 
duce evidence that they had sur-| 
rendered ration points when it was} 
purchased, an enforcement lawyer} 
said.

at the same time nourishing. 

So far as the problem child is 
concerned—the one who wants to 
eat all the time or who won't eat 
enough—he should be dealt with by 
first scrutinizing his meals. Over 
or undereating, our authority re- 
marked, is generally a sign that 
the menus aren’t suited to the 
youngster’s needs. Either he is 
seeking constantly for something 
to satisfy a hidden craving or he is 
too reduced in energy to care about 
food. Once meals are brought into 
balance, habits become normal. 

Lastly, in respect to between- 
meal eating, Miss Clark advised 
something light, which would not 
interfere with the regular meal 
pattern. Fruit and raw vegetable 
are indicated rather than peanut 
butter sandwiches, 
and rich cookies.

| Open-pored wood like oak, ma- 
jhogany and walnut, he suggested, 
lcan be given a “light pore” effect 
by filing with special white wood 
filler before applying the finish. If 
plywoods such as those of the 
Douglas fir class, are to be painted, 
he advised, they should be given a 
coat of synthetic resin first to pre- 
vent the grain from showing 
through. 

Mr. Arndt concluded his lecture 
with a general caution to home 
builders who are “going to be buy- 
ing a great many things you have 
never bought before,’’ some of 
which will be replaced in later 
years, some never. “Don’t skimp 
on the parts of your house that 
either cannot be replaced or are ex- 
tremely expensive and troublesome 
to replace,” he urged, and sited as 
examples: footings, foundation, 
|framework, windows and doors, 
basic interior wall coverings, insu- 
lation, concealed plumbing and con- 
cealed wiring.

CHICAGO, April 30 (#)—About 
1,600,000 pounds less beef, veal, 
pork and lamb has been produced 
in the first four months of 1945 
than was produced in the same pe- 
riod last year, the American Meat 
Institute estimated today. 

The institute’s monthly analysis 
said that more than 400,000,000 
pounds less meat which might 
move in interstate commerce was 
produced in April, 1945, compared 
with the same month last year. 
The institute further stated: 


“April meat production for all} 


kinds showed substantial reduction 
compared with the preceding 
month—beef and veal, 19 and 18 
per cent, respectively, lamb and 
pork, 13 per cent, respectively. 
April pork production of approxi- 
mately 435,000,000 pounds was 48 
per cent less than a year ago that 
month; veal 14 per cent less; beef 
was the same; and sheep and 
lambs increased 10 per cent in 
April comparéd with a year ago.”

Tests will determine how suc-

While it was held during regents’

period has been moved forward at 
the request of local school authori- 
ties. 

Commenting on last year’s check- 
up in a letter to superintendents 
and principals, Mr. Stoddard said: 

“The results, while incomplete, 
are none the less_ significant. 
Strengths and weaknesses in the

$10,000 Worth of New Garb) 
Barely Escapes Inclusion in | 
Dress Institute Gift 

| 


Comedies of errors developed | 
yesterday in the clothing collection | 
drive. A dress manufacturer near- 
ly lost $10,000 worth of new 
dresses, mistaken for old clothes. 
From the Bronx came a frantic 
call from a father whose son had 
taken his only coat to donate in 
exchange for two baseball tickets. 
And three small boys carried 
seven-pound bundles of clothes to 
“Circus Lane” for free circus 
tickets, only to discover they had 
a two-and-a-half-hour wait before 
the collection booth opened. 

The three boys, none more than/ 
5 years old, appeared at 8:30 A. M.| 
at the “lane”’ in front of Franklin | 
Simon & Co., Fifth Avenue and 
Thirty-eighth Street, only to find 
the depot would not open until 11. 
They sat down on the curbstone to 
wait. Passers-by, impressed by 
their persistence and their thread- 
bare appearance, started tossing 
pennies and nickels until the boys 
had collected 35 cents. 

The tickets the boys received 
brought to 9,000 the total distrib- 
uted at the store, and their cloth- 
ing donations increased to 63,000 
pounds the amount brought in ex- 
change for circus tickets since last 
Thursday afternoon. Four thou-| 
sand tickets for this Saturday's 
morning performance still remain | 
for distribution. Box seats will be} 
given to Army and Navy men at}

Important Phase of Our History 


The result is a book that makes a valuable con-

American history; one that offers an exhaustive 
account of a great industrial development with-

a linguist, a student of history and philosophy 
and an accomplished performer on the flute. But 
as he became disillusioned by the graft and un- 
fair competition of American business, and as his 
absorption in his work increased, he became harsh 
and hard. He could give generously to charity 
and house a dozen persons in his home, but he 
was a cruel and irascible father who beat his 
children needlessly, and a cold and indifferent 
husband. He had a “sublime and prophetic faith” 
in the suspension type of construction, imple- 
mented by enormous energy and ability, but he 
must have been unpleasant to live with. Yet he 
had another side to his nature. After his death

“The Builders of the Bridge” is not written 
with much literary felicity. Nevertheless, it is 
an able and interesting biography of two inter- 
esting and significant Americans.

3D ANNUAL DISPLAY 
BY ARTISTS LEAGUE 


Work of Many Newcomers Is 
Included in Exhibition at 
Riverside Museum 


By EDWARD ALDEN JEWELL 
The Artists League of America 


jis holding its third annual exhibi-| 


tion at the Riverside Museum, Riv- 
erside Drive at 103d Street. The 
display will continue through May 
27. Hours are 1 to 5 P. M. The 
galleries are closed Mondays. 

The Artists League is an off- 
shoot of two previous organiza- 
tions; the American Artists’ Con- 
gress and the United American 
Artists, CIO, products of the de- 
pression years, In the course of 
an enthusiastic foreword Hudson 
D. Walker remarks: 

“This is a democratic organiza- 
tion of professional artists and 
young artists who have not yet 
made their mark. Therefore the 
exhibition is a cross section of va- 
rious levels of achievement, from 
some of our best known and 
strongest artists down to the 
young artists who constitute our 
hope for the future development of 
art in America, This presupposes 
a certain unevenness. * * * Due 
to the fact that between sixty and 
seventy members of the organiza- 
tion are in the armed forces and 
many more are largely engaged in 
war work and can devote only a 
small part of their time to their 
profession, there is a much higher 
percentage of women represented 
in the exhibition than is customary 
in peace years.” 

The show is indeed uneven. But 
a prime asset is the inclusion of 
work by so many newscomers: 
painters and sculptors ‘‘completely 
unknown even to the art world.” 
With their names and entries the 


BOOKS 


Strautin’s symbolically interroga- 
tive “Shall This Happen Again?” 

The oil section of the show is 
generally superior to that com- 
posed of watercolors. There are 
eleven sculptural pieces, of which 
| perhaps the best is Seymour Lip- 
|ton’s stylized “Clowns,” excellent 
in design. “La Volupte,” by 
Rosa Newman Walinska, possesses 
| strength.

An American artist who went 


|through the landings at Tarawa 
and other bloody struggles in the 
|Pacific with the Marine Corps will 


| show today the pictorial record 
ithat he brought back from the 
beaches and jungles. 

Kerr Eby, whose etchings had 
brought him wide recognition, and 
who is now 55 years old, went 
through the hardships in the Pa- 
cific to record the heroic actions of 
the marines. A veteran of the 
First World War, Mr. Eby hated 
war so much that some years be- 
fore the outbreak of the present 
conflict he made a series of etch- 
ings of war in all its horror in an 
effort to discourage it by bringing 
home its suffering to civilians. 

His present set of drawings 
shows the heroism as well as the 
tragedy and suffering of battle. 
The pictures are to go on exhibition 
this afternoon at the Associated 
American Artists, 711 Fifth Ave- 
nue. The entire collection of draw- 
ings will be donated to the Navy 
by the Abbott Laboratories, who 
commissioned Mr. Eby to make 
them. The preview this afternoon, 
at which the admission fee will 
be $5, is for the benefit of the 
Protestant Big Sisters. The draw- 
ings will remain on view through 
Saturday. Admission for the re- 
mainder of the week will be $1.

some of the best paintings are by 
artists here encountered for the 
first time in the experience of this

Expressionism abounds, much of 
it heavy or shrill, offset by ad- 
mirable accomplishments such as 
Dorothy Sherry’s small “Shipyard” 
and Jan Kaplan's glowing “Flower 
Piece.” Certain items fall within 
the ambit of right-wing acad- 
emism, and there are a few left- 
wing reminiscences that, for ex- 
ample, bear oblique reference to 
cubism. “Primitive” notes also are 
sounded here and there, reminding

THE END IS NEAR 


Once more,.as in the stirring days of 


November, 1918, the world is waiting | 


with bated breath for another and far 


more dangerous and ruthless German | 
and for another | 


Empire to collapse, 
European war to end. Once more, as 
nearly twenty-seven years ago, the air 
is full of rumors and reports of an 
t German surrender and nego- 
and every- 


imminen 
tiations for an armistice; 
where, even in some 
lands, a tortured humanity is standing 


by to celebrate in prayer or jubilation |

Whatever the truth of the individual | 
reports, this much is clear: the end is | 


mear. Another would-be world con- 


queror, more savage and more nearly | 


successful than any in the past, has 
come to the end of a road that began 
in chaos and ends in history’s greatest 
cataclysm. Whether Himmler swal- 
lows Hitler’s promise that Germany 
will never capitulate, and capitulates 


after all; whether in the process the | 


Nazi hangman eliminates Hitler him- 
self and others who might stand in his 
way: whether he is even able to sur- 
render anything or anybody except 
himself and his immediate following, in 
the hope of clemency; or whether the 
trapped Nazi fanatics must be cut 
down one by one in their individual 
pockets of resistance, are now only 
details of the vast historic drama un- 
folding itself before our eyes. They are 


interesting and important details be- 


cause on them may still hang the lives | 
of many Allied soldiers. But the details | 


can no longer affect the end itself or 


postpone it long. A totalitarian system | 


is in a state of total collapse, and ter- 
rible is its fall.

enough or strong enough to dominate 
the world. 


VICTORY IN ITALY 


| The German army in Italy will never 

cross the Brenner Pass. Some rem- 
| nants of that once-mighty force may 
| make the attempt. But the main body 
| of the army that held half of Italy in 
| subjection has been destroyed. Gen. 
Mark Clark announces that twenty-five 
divisions, of which more than 120,000 
| are already prisoners, have been “torn 
to pieces.” We are at the Alps on the 
Swiss border. Milan, Genoa, Venice are 
in our hands. Our troops have swept 
beyond the Piave. The rest is mop- 
ping-up. 

The long campaign is over. It started 
in September, 1943, when the British 
landed in Calabria and we hacked out 
our beachhead at Salerno. Some of the 
hardest battles of the war were fought 
on this front. The ruins of Cassino 
mark an inferno. There have been stir- 
ring dashes, such as that which liber- 
ated Rome, and creeping advances 
| against rock-hewn lines from which 
| the Germans had to be blasted boulder 
by boulder. Italy is an ancient battle- 
ground, but no conqueror of the past 
| ever pierced the Italian mountains from 
end to end. Never in history has any 
| army done what this brave army of 
many nations and races accomplished 
against almost insuperable obstacles. 
No victory in this war has been more 
brilliant. 

The final blow fell with the impact 
of a mountain avalanche. The British 
Eighth Army sweeping up from the 
Adriatic shore, and the American Fifth 
sweeping down from the, Apennines, 
broke the back of German resistance 
on the banks of the Po. It was said 
many times that our advance in Italy 
was held up by the need of men and 
equipment on other fronts. Perhaps 
| the Germans had heard that too, and 
lingered too long. But when the drive 
| came it was launched with crushing 
power. Beyond the Po the enemy re- 
treat became a rout. In twenty-two 
| days this German army had ceased to 
| exist as a coherent fighting force. The 

Germans are giving up now by whole 
| divisions. The five divisions of Gra- 
ziani’s Ligurian army are trying to 
surrender. Some German detachments 
| are standing stubbornly at the northern 
| end of Lake Garda, apparently hoping 
| to hold open the gateway to the Bren- 
ner, eighty miles beyond. It is a hope- 
less stand. Marshal Alexander planned 
| to catch the Germans in a trap. Gen- 

eral Clark closed the trap. Now there 
is no German army in Italy, only some 
| shattered fragments. 











GREATER NEW YORK FUND 


The business community of New 
York will have an opportunity to 
testify, in an eloquent way, to its faith 
in the city and the institutions of 
| American life when the Greater New 

York Fund opens its 1945 campaign 
tomorrow night. Annually for seven 
years past the business firms of the 
city, great and small, have demon- 
strated their essential good-heartedness 
| by answering the appeal. No one can 
doubt that they will respond as gener- 
ously as before and prove again that 
“New York cares for its own.” 

More than 400 local voluntary hos- 
| pitals and health and welfare agencies 





| look to the Fund for assistance in sup- 
porting their humane work. They must 
|; spend $85,000,000 this year. Of that 
| amount some $62,500,000 will be made 
up from their fees and endowment in- 
| come, leaving $22,500,000 yet to be 
| raised. Of this remainder the Greater 
New York Fund will endeavor to ob- 
| tain at least $4,500,000 as the business 
community’s contribution. It is hoped 
this amount will be exceeded, thus re- 
ducing the sum which the agencies will 
| still have to find through their own 
separate or federated appeals. 

The Fund serves the moral and physi- 
cal good of all residents of the five bor- 
oughs and of all who work here. It 
benefits all races and creeds. Last year 
it brought help in time of trouble to 
| two and one-half million persons. It 
means, among other things, visiting- 
nurse attendance for the old and the ill; 
training of nurses for overseas; home 
| guidance for bewildered families of our 
| fighting men; day shelter for children 
| of working mothers, and preventive 





| measures against tuberculosis, cancer 
and heart ailments. This year, with 
| the backwash of war sweeping closer, 
| the help given by the Fund will be 
| more needed than ever in the past. 

Some 8,000 volunteers, under the 
leadership of J. Stewart Baker, will 
present the appeal to the business 
| world of New York in the days at hand. 
| May they succeed in their high un- 
| dertaking. 





LATIN-AMERICAN SCHOOLS 


Agreements have been signed with 
twelve South American countries to 
| cooperate in the improvement of school 
| systems in the Western Hemisphere. 
| By the end of the summer similar ar- 
|}rangements are expected to be com- 
| pleted with eighteen nations. Under 
the direction of the Office of Inter- 
American Affairs, this far-reaching 
| project, which“is to cost $10,000,000, 
| half of which is to be provided by this 
country, has already shown its useful- 
;ness. Many scholars from Latin 
| America are already here. At the same 
time American educators and adminis- 
| trators are in the southern countries, 
offering suggestions and giving assist- 
| ance in the reorganization of educa- 
| tional practices. 
| Fortunately, this program is not one 
| Way. American scholars realize that 
| they can find helpful ideas in Latin- 
| American nations which should prove 
valuable on their return here. For the 
moment, though, our educators have 
agreed to advise the Latin Americans 
on the latest practices or techniques in 
the elementary, secondary and normal 
school fields. Special emphasis is being

placed on vocational and rural edu- 
cation, 

In Latin-American lands the recep- 
tion of American educators has been 
cordial. A mutual give-and-take is 
creating a wholesome atmosphere of 
good-will. The Inter-American Educa- 
tional Foundation, created by Congress 
to coordinate this project, plans to have 
responsible staffs of field workers in 
nearly all of the South American coun- 
tries. Books, equipment and educa- 
tional supplies will be sent when 
needed. The result ought to be mutual 
profit through the establishment of 
higher standards in education. 


THE FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT 


The one man to whom our present 
great Navy owes the most is Franklin 
D. Roosevelt. He was the most Navy- 
minded President in our history. As 
far back as his first term in office he 
foresaw our growing need and used his 
influence to promote the rebuilding of 
the Navy that had been allowed to fall 
so far behind the other navies of the 
world, especially Japan. Many of the 
Ships that have borne the principal 
burden of the war in the Pacific were 
planned or laid down before Dec. 7, 1941. 

As he himself delighted in setting 
precedents, so the Navy honors him in 
breaking with tradition to give his 
name to our newest and greatest air- 
craft carrier, 
larger than a destroyer has been named 
for a man in our modern Navy. As 
she prepares to take her place in our 
far-flung battle line, all America can 
join in the traditional wartime naval 
farewell to a ship embarking on a 
perilous mission against the enemy. 
To the Franklin D. Roosevelt ‘good 
hunting and good luck.” 


VETERANS’ SOUNDING POST 

Thousands of soldiers have lost their 
hearing in whole or in part as a con- 
Sequence of service at the front. We 
pay less attention to these afflicted 
men than we do to the visibly crippled. 
The military hospitals can begin the 
work of hearing rehabilitation, but they 
cannot complete it. Ear specialists do 
what they can. Mechanical hearing aids 
of the right type are supplied. Lip- 
reading is taught. There is vocational 
guidance. But when the day of dis- 
charge comes, the transition is sudden 
and bewildering. 

At one stroke the doctors, the nurses 
and teachers disappear. The civilian 
world must be faced, a world which 
does not read lips. For all the aid the 
Government has lent, the discharged 
soldiers with impaired hearing need 
more. They want to meet their own 
kind; they want to practice lip-reading 
and voice-control; they want to learn 
how the most can be made of hearing 
aids; they want to learn the road back 
to normal life; they want to solve a 
problem in social adaptation. Hence 
the work done in the military hospitals 
must be supplemented. That supple- 
mentary work is to be undertaken by 
the New York League for the Hard of 
Hearing, a philanthropic organization 
which was established thirty-five years 
ago and which examines and counsels 
every week about a hundred persons in 
civilian life who come to it for advice. 
The soldiers themselves have estab- 
lished a Veterans’ Sounding Post within 
the League for their own benefit—a 
memorial to Lieut. Lester N. Hof- 
heimer. 

Inadequately housed, equipped and 
financed, the League can reach only a 
small fraction of the millions in these 
parts who suffer from auditory defects, 
and only a limited number of the many 
soldiers who will turn to it for aid. It 
should grow from a charitable institu- 
tion into a social center which will give 
not only scientific aid and advice and 
teach lip-reading and voice control but 
bring the hard of hearing together and 
make them part of the community’s 
religious and cultural life. A campaign 
which is to start this week to achieve 
this end deserves whole-hearted public 
support. 


POST-WAR TAXES AND SPENDING 


The extent to which tax rates can 
be decreased in the post-war period 
will depend upon the level of Govern- 
ment spending at that time. High-level 
spending will necessarily mean high- 
level taxation if we are ever to achieve 
the long-lost goal of a balanced budget. 
Roswell Magill, former Under-Secre- 
tary of the Treasury, has given an in- 
formative appraisal of the problem in 
his recent talk before the Chartered 
Life Underwriters. On the basis of a 
national income of $125,000,000,000 and 
a peacetime budget of $22,000,000,000, 
Dr. Magill estimates that the present 
exemptions of $500 per person must be 
maintained and that the starting tax 
rate for individuals “would need to be 
at least 20 per cent and even more than 
that unless there were use of very 
heavy taxes at all other points.” These 
estimates assume the elimination of the 
excess profits tax and moderate re- 
ductions in surtaxes upon individuals 
and possibly in corporate income taxes. 
Should the rate of Government spend- 
ing be lower than $22,000,000,000, taxes 
could be reduced correspondingly. 

Thus the key question is the level of 
post-war spending. Most estimates of 
the minimum expenditures required to 
meet post-war commitments are run- 
ning in the neighborhood of $20,000,- 
000,000. And these estimates do not 
make full allowance for large-scale 
public works projects, for the Govern- 
ment investment required to under- 
write 60,000,000 jobs, a major exten- 
sion of social security, and the numer- 
ous other proposals for large post-war 
spending. If we were to let the bars 
down and attempt to spend ourselves 
into post-war prosperity, as many 
planners advocate, then it is clear that 
little or no tax relief could be antici- 
pated. 

We must balance the claimed advan- 
tages of such spending against the cost. 
As Dr. Magill says, “taxation is always 
burdensome, yet it is the price we must 
pay for the services of government. In- 
telligent fiscal planning demands a 
constant balancing, by legislators and 
their constituents, of the burdens of ad- 


the first time a _ ship |

ditional taxation against the gains to 
be derived from additional government 
service.” Unfortunately, in too many 
cases the question of cost is ignored, 
while the benefits to be derived are ex- 
aggerated out of all relationship to 
their importance. 

If the tax load is to be reduced when 
the war is over, then free spending can- 
not be tolerated. We must make our 
choice.

EN ROUTE TO SAN FRANCISCO 
—When this correspondent left Wash-

putes had been settled. The Army and 
Navy had won their basic point in the

from the west and six Soviet armies 
from the east. In the west they are 
one Canadian army, one British army, 
four American armies and one French 
army. On the eastern front they are

Ukrainian armies. It is the First White

praise Mr. Truman, for these were the 
first great problems he faced. The 
record that had been made prior to his 
accession was something of a stum- 
bling block. The Atlantic Charter had 
encouraged many to think that the 
principle and details of international 
supervision of the peoples and terri- 
tories taken by us from Japan, and held 
by the Army and Navy to be strategic, 
were a necessary contribution by the 





that took Vienna and is now on its way 
to strike hands with the Americans | 
somewhere in Czechoslovakia. 


But by now it is a} 
familiar bit of knowledge 
that White Russia and 
Ukraine are only two 
member republics of the 
Soviet Union. Together they have a | 
population of approximately fifty mil- | 
lion in a total Soviet population of | 
more than 180 million. The biggest of 
all Soviet republics is the Russian So- 
viet Federated Socialist Republic, for | 
convenience the R.S.F.S.R. It has more 
than twice the joint population of 
Ukraine and White Russia. It stretches | 
from the Baltic and Leningrad through 
Moscow and Stalingrad to the Pacific | 
and Vladivostok. It is odd that nearly 
two-thirds of the Soviet fighting 
strength should thus be absent from | 
the supreme effort and the supreme | 
hour in the war against the Fascist 
enemy. It seems hard to escape the | 
conclusion that the six so-called White 
Russian and Ukrainian armies now | 
writing Hitler’s doom are composed in | 
great part, and probably for the great- 
est part, of men from the R.S.F.S.R.,

Why all the honor to 
Ukraine and White Russia | 
and why the self-effacement | 
of the big, strapping senior 
partner in the Soviet Union? 
The reason is far from a sinister one, | 
and ‘it takes us straightaway to San | 
Francisco, where it may help to ex- 
plain certain puzzling items in Mr. 
Molotoff’s behavior. When the Soviet 
Government demands separate League 
membership for Ukraine and White 
Russia, and Mr, Molotoff presses home | 
the demand, it is not primarily that 
Marshal Stalin is greatly concerned 
about being outvoted in the new world 
organization. The principal reason is 
probably a desire to advertise Ukraine | 
and White Russia; to publicize the fact 
that the Soviet Union is a federation | 
of free and equal republics. 


Place 
in the 
Sun 


The one feature in | 
the whole Soviet ‘“ex- | 
periment” that has | 
evoked heartiest ap- | 
proval in the outside 
world is the Soviet Union's nationalities | 
policy. It grants the fullest cultural | 
self-determination for all “national- | 
ities,” from forty million people ... the 
Ukrainian Soviet Republic to a scant | 
million Pamir mountaineers in the | 
Tadzhik Soviet Republic. It grants | 
political self-rule to the member re- 
publics. Whether the practice in Soviet | 
Russia corresponds to the theory need 
not detain us here. To emphasize the 
self-determined position of Ukraine | 
and White Russia is good publicity for 
the Soviet Union in general. 


Soviet 
Nationalities 
Policy 





A similar motive | 
was probably behind 
Mr. Molotoff’s suc- 
cessful demand for 
four chairmen in ro- 
tation at the San Francisco Conference 
instead of one permanent chairman. 
Soviet prestige entered into consider- 
ation, of course. Once in four turns the 
Soviet delegate would be in the chair. 
But specifically one suspects there was 
the desire to advertise before the world 
a characteristic Soviet product. This 
is the ‘“‘presidium.” 

The presidium is as familiar a word 
in Soviet Russia as it is unfamiliar 
outside. Wherever you look, in the 
Soviet Government, in the Communist 
party, in the Soviet trade union or- 
ganizations, the set-up is the same. | 
Power is never exercised by one man 
but always by councils (soviets), com- 
mittees, boards.

Mr. Kalinin has nine or ten vice chair-

munist party is under the authority 
ot a central] committee which in turn 
is directed by a political bureau, the

And there 
had been complaints in Congress and 
the country that the Russians misun- 
derstood repeated concessions as na- 
tional weakness. 

In the first affair, the Secretaries of 
War and Navy, wholly supporting their 
principal staffs and commanders, pro- 
tested to the President against so 
broad an application of the principle of 
trusteeships. They argued that bases 
in these former mandates and enemy 
areas are an essential foundation of 
that security which is the aspiration of 
San Francisco because: the United 
States cannot sensibly be viewed as a 
future aggressor by any member of 
the United Nations; the total of the 
native populations affected is incon- 
siderable; the ability of these peoples 
to govern themselves at any time in 
the near future is improbable; and to 
apply the full formula to these areas 
and peoples is impractical as well as 
dangerous, 


Ideal Preserved 

The President, after listening care- 
fully to both points of view, sustained 
the Army and Navy chiefs on the ma- 
But he also saw the validity 


the State Department was contending 
—that the United Nations should not 
be barred from the local territory be- 
yond "the bases if the future assembly 
wished to look into social and economic 
conditions, and that the United States 
should leave no impression it was emu- 


that were given them as mandates by 
the League of Nations. So he agreed | 
to permit the Atlantic Charter ideal to 
be interwoven in the plan, which was 
satisfactory to all concerned in Wash- 
ington and full protection to this na- 
tion against a future Pacific aggressor. | 

In the second argument, the Presi- 


dent had more difficulties in the way | 


of solution. This is because there is 
reason to believe his military and 
naval chiefs in the beginning were not 
united on the wisdom of being too spe- 
with the Russians about the 
strength of our armed forces. One 
view was that, to make the case with 
full power, too much information that 
has been held secret for security rea- 


other opinion 
might be affronted at a critical time 
in the Pacific war and in the delibera- 


The President, it is said, having 
made up his mind that straight talk, 
with demonstrable facts behind it, was 
the kind of argument best understood 
and appreciated at Moscow, persuaded 
the doubters that their fears were out- 
weighed by the advantages. And, 
though a smooth pathway for the 


same quarter, there are evidences Mr.

German Political Prisoners 


Concentration Camp Victims Held to 
Include Many Anti-Nazis 


To THE EDITOR oF THE New YorK TIMES: 

May I add a few remarks to the hair- 
raising reports from the concentration 
camp at Buchenwald and from other 
places of Nazi sadism. As a member 
of the German Reichstag opposed to 
Hitler I was argested on March 12, 
1933, taken first to a county jail and in 
June, 1933, I was transferred to the 
first concentration camp the Nazis or- 
ganized, in Oranienburg near Berlin. 
We were then 1,800 political prisoners, 
10 per cent Jewish and 90 per cent 
Christians like myself. The ill treat- 
ment we suffered was exactly the same 
as has been revealed now in the latest 
reports; even in 1933 the death rate in 
the concentration camps was 13 per 
cent. 

I managed to escape from the camp 
in December, 1933; in January, 1934, 
my wife and our baby daughter, 17 
months old, were taken prisoner and 
held as hostages in a men’s concentra- 
tion camp. A member of the House of 
Commons who visited Buchenwald last 
week had been instrumental in obtain- 
ing the release of my family: Mrs. Mal- 
vin Tate, M. P.; she flew to Berlin and 
brought my wife and daughter to me in 
London. 


Cruelties Termed Propaganda 


| Lecturing in Europe and, since 1934, 
| in this country, about the unspeakable 
cruelties of the Nazis, I have found 
many persons who would not believe 
what I said. Up to very recently the 
reports about the incredible sadism 
of the Nazis were considered by many 
as “propaganda.” Now, at last, the 
public knows that we, German anti- 
Nazis, told the truth. 

In all fairness it should be empha- 
sized that a very large proportion of 
the prisoners now found in these horri- 
ble camps are German anti-Nazis; in 
Buchenwald alone there were tens of 
thousands of them. Before the war, 
the Nazi concentration camps were 
populated solely by German political 
| prisoners and Jewish victims, but the 
| world at large took little notice of that 
fact. It seems to me that inadequate 
attention is now being paid to the fact 
that untold thousands of German anti- 
Nazis are among the masses of prison- 
ers now being liberated by the victori- 
ous Allied armies. 

Sabotage Aids Allies 

Some correspondents reporting from 
inside Germany, speaking of the con- 
centration-camp victims, have distin- 
guished between foreign workers who 
were imprisoned there and “political 
prisoners,” without mentioning their 
nationality. I believe it should be made 
clear that the term “political prisoners” 
means German anti-Nazis. It is in the 
Allied interest to recognize the fact 
that there are many German anti- 
Nazis upon whose assistance our mili- 
tary government officers have already 
begun to rely; in fact, the Office of War 
Information only this week distributed 
a report to German-language news- 
papers in this country, stating that Ger- 
man anti-Nazis have helped save a 
number of important plants which the 
Nazis ordered to be destroyed and 
| which anti-Nazis saved by sabotaging 
the Nazi orders. 

Only those who have lived under the 
Nazi system can fully understand the 
effectiveness of the Nazi terror, The 
reports of some correspondents men- 
tion that foreign slaves in Germany, as 
|a result of the force of habit, were 
wont to step off the sidewalk when uni- 
formed Nazis passed by—and these 
people were in the clutches of the Nazis 
for only five years; Germans who lived 
under the pressure of deadly fear for 
| twelve years and still maintained their 
anti-Nazi convictions deserve recog- 
| nition. GERHART H. SEGER.

“Germany Must Pay” 


To THE Epitor or THE New York TIMES: 
As V-E Day is so near, and natural- 
ly our interest in what Germany ought 
to be made to pay is increasing, may I 
call your attention (as an aid to think- 
ing) to an occurrence which was a 





What an Adviser Said 

An adviser of the Administration, 
one of the few skilled in international 
dealings, said something like this to 
him: 

Mr. President, the Red Army is won- 
derful, It is unbelievably brave, and 
the decisive stand at Stalingrad de- 
serves all the pride the Russians have 
in it. But, conceding all that, conced- 
ing the indispensable part the Red 
Army has played in the collapse of the 
Nazis, the Red Army without us can- 
not give Europe, Asia or even Russia 
security. 

It has fought on one front. But we 
have fought simultaneously on many. 
Our industrial machine is incomparably 
greater, more skillful and more re- 
sourceful, as the Russians themselves 
know through Lend-Lease and other- 
wise. And, in the unthinkable event of 
hostilities in which our air. forces and 
fleets would be on the other side, the 


| plight of the Russians would be des- 


perate. They do not seem to realize 
how vital we are to their security as 
well as to that of the world. It would 
be proper and most useful for you to 
make that brutally plain. 

From what this correspondent heard 
before leaving Washington, the Presi- 
dent did not reject the substance of 
this advice, 


——e 


IMMUNITY 


Love is only f.r the young? 
True that is, and sweet— 

But time itself plays magic tunes 
For lovers’ ageless feet 

Whereby it grants a wondrous boon 
Against the days of cold 

That it enchants them strangely so, 
No lovers can grow old! 

VIRGINIA SCOTT MINER. 


tember, 1923. 

Wilhelm Cuno, the then German 
Chancellor, resigned that office Aug. 
12, 1923, was almost immediately 
elected president of the Hamburg- 
American Line, and in connection with 


the interview which he gave on or soon 
after arriving, he was asked many 
questions about the situation in Ger- 
many. An answer to one of the ques- 
tions was: “Germany lost the war. 
| Therefore Germany must pay.” That 
being true at the end of World War I, 
it is many times more true when Ger- 
many loses this war.

Republiéan Action on Trade Act 


TO THE EDITOR oF THE New YorRK TIMES: 

In your editorial ‘For Republicans— 
Which Way?” in your issue of April 
20, you conclude with a statement that 
| you would like to hear “the voices of 
Republicans outside of Congress— 
among them the voices of Governor 
Dewey, Herbert Hoover and Alf Lan- 
don—speak out on this question.” 

These three estimable men are only 
part of the body of over twenty-two 
million men and women throughout this 
land who vote under the emblem of the 
eagle. As one of these, may I ask 
| that this voice be given space in your 
columns. 





| pression, 
an emergency act. Republicans did not 
| support it, as a matter of national 
policy. 

In 1940, with the world at war and 
‘our own Government extending aid to

his duties came to New York City. In | 


The original Hull Trade Agreement | 
| Act of 1934 was passed during a ‘de- | 
It was extended in 1937 as 


Great Britain, Republicans give their 
liberal support to the issue. Again, in 
1943, Republicans supported the exten- 
sion, but limited the period to two 
years instead of three. This was done 
in recognition of our war situation and 
not as an endorsement of a peacetime 
trade policy. The bill now pending has 
a wartime significance and should be 
extended for one year without changes 
in tariff duties, just as the Lend-Lease 
Act has had a one-year extension. The 
above facts put the recorf clear on the 
Republican voting on the Trade Agree- 
ments Acts. FRANCIS A. ADAMS. 
New York, April 21, 1945. 


Dodecanese Not Represented 


Conference is Asked to Make Islands 
a Part of Greece 


£0 THE EDITOR oF THE New YorK Trmgs: 

In your editorial of April 18 you 
justly deplore the fact that at the San 
Francisco Conference “the forty-fifth 
chair,” reserved for “Poland, first vie- 
tim of Nazi tyranny in the present 
war,” will be vacant. 

May I remind you, however, that 
there is in Europe another people which 

will not be present, although a vic- 
tim of imperialism and fascism for 
thirty-three years. I refer to the peo- 

| ple of the Dodecanese Islands. Al- 
though the Dodecanesians have been 
under Italian domination, they are 
Greeks and unquestionably part of the 
United Nations. Natives of these is- 
lands are serving in the Greek and the 
American Armies and Navies, and 
more than one-third of the Greek mer- 
chant marine is owned and manned by 
Dodecanesians. 

The great powers have given every 
indication that they regard the Dodeec- 
anesians as friends. In 1942 our De- 
partment of Justice officially removed 
those resident in this country from the 
category of enemy aliens, although 
their homeland was under Italian rule. 
The British Minister of State, the 
Right Hon. Richard Law, declared in 
the House of Commons (Oct. 18, 1944) 
that the inhabitants of the Dodecanese 
“will not be treated as enemies or ex- 
enemies but as friends.” 

In spite of this, the people of the 
Dodecanese will be without represen- 
tation at the San Francisco Conference. 
Since the capitulation of Italy these 
islands are not internationally recog- 
nized as belonging to any state, and 
they have, of course, no Government 
of their own. The repeated claim of 
| the Dodecanesians to te officially 
recognized as part of their mother 
country, Greece, still awaits final con- 
firmation. In consequence, technically 
the Greek delegates will not represent 
the Dodecanesian people. Italy will not 
be present, although even if she were 
this would afford no representation for 
| the Dodecanesians. 

This injustice could easily be reme- 
| died by a declaration made now by the 
| Big Three that the Dodecanese will be 
"united with Greece. The Dodecanese 
question is unique in that Greece has no 
opponent in claiming this area. 

Secretary of State Stettinius, writing 
on the San Francisco Conference, has 
pointed out that the plan for an inter- 
national organization must be sup- 
ported “not merely by governments but 
by peoples.” 

Let us hope, then, that the great 
powers will without delay declare the 
Dodecanese part of Greece. This will 
demonstrate especially to small nations 
| and oppressed peoples that their great 
| allies have the same regard for all, 
whether they deal with a mighty nation 
of 150,000,000“persons or with a group 
which is small and weak, numbering 
only 150,000—for this is about the total 

number of Dodecanesians throughout 

the world. Dr. N. G. MAVRIS, 

President, Dodecanesian National Coun- 
cil.

Veterans’ Care Is Questioned 


| To TH# Epitor or THe New York Trae: 
I cut out your editorial in yesterday's 

TIMES and sent it to my son in the 
| South Pacific with the comment: “You 
| have been hearing me say this since 
1934.” The “this” is the statement: 
“There should be no surprise at the 
conditions that are being revealed day 
after day in German prison camps. 
What did we expect from the Nazi?” 
| etc. 

“If there is one attribute that most 
distinguishes the civilized man from 
the barbarian it is his attitude toward 
those who are helpless under his com 
trol.” I agree. 

We have a condition in this country 
that is as bad in some cases as what 
happens to the helpless in Germany. 
Read “The Veteran Betrayed” in the 
May Reader’s Digest and you will find 
that we have our tortire chambers and 
neglected soldiers right among as.

Selfishness Inherent 


To THE Epitor or THe New York Times: 

In THE TIMES of April 15 the ten 
peace points approved by the American 
Psychological Association are set forth, 
but might some humble layman take 
issue with part of Point 1, “War is not 

born in men.” 

Man is born selfish. We all wish ® 
were otherwise, but can we shut our 
eyes to the facts? Instinct, heredity 
dominate most of mankind. Our remote 

| ancestor survived because he had a 
heavier club than his neighbor's, and 
his descendant of today differs in that 
his weapons are more efficient. 

Some may outgrow, may suppress 
that selfishness, but as for the rest of 
us, What is the remedy? Should we not 
school ourselves in the belief that our 

self-interest, perhaps our survival, calls 
for a decent, righteous, tolerant atti- 
tude toward our fellow-man, individual 
and national?

RAN STATION ON HIS OWN 


Says Attorney General Came 


Only to Collect Receipts—

Special to Tax New Yorx Times 

NEWARK, N. J., April 30— 
Judge John Clark Knox in Federal 
Court here today denied motions 
by defense counsel to dismiss the 
majority of seven counts in the 
gasoline black-market indictment 
against Attorney General Walter 
D. Van Riper, Imperial Service 
Station, Inc.,. which Mr. Van 
Riper controls, and John Praml, 
former manager of the station. 

The court ruled that the charges 
in five counts in the indictment, 
which relate to trafficking by the 
three defendants in counterfeit and 
stolen gasoline coupons and the 
sale of gasoline over the ceiling 
price, would be considered by the 
jury. 

The defense, after openings to 
the jury in which the case was 


characterized as “not just an ordi-| 
nary one,” produced Pram! as its! 
who had} 


first witness. Praml, 
pleaded guilty to the first two 
counts when the trial opened eight 
days ago, testified that Mr. Van 
Ripper remained ignorant of his 
(Praml's) purchases of black mar- 
ket coupons and gasoline until 
after the Office of Price Adminis- 
tration began an investigation of 
his own and the station’s opera- 
tions. 
Says Van Riper Was “Put Out” 


“What did ne say when you told 
him?” asked his counsel, Richard 
J. Fitzmaurice. 

“He was quite put out about it,” 
was the reply. “He swore—lI’ll tell 
you that.” 

Asked what Mr. Van Riper ad- 
vised him to do, he said: 

“He told me to go down to the 
OPA and make a clean breast of 
it.’ 

The witness's version of alleged 
black market coupon deals differed 
sharply with that told last Wednes- 
day by William H. Miller, convict- 
ed black marketer, who testified 
that Mr. Van Riper was present 
and participated in the purchase 
last August of 1,000 consumer type 
gas coupons for $130. 

Denying that he had ever pur- 
chased any but inventory type 
stamps from Miller, Praml, de- 
scribing events that day, said: 

“The judge drove into the gas 
station, said ‘Hello’ to Miller, 
asked me to look at the battery in 
his car, walked into the office and 
cashed a check, I think, and then 
he got in his car and drove away.” 

Miller, the witness testified, 
told him he was getting the cou- 
pons from “an OPA office or ra- 
tioning board.” 

“Did he tell you how he got 
them ?” 

“No.” 

Pram! admitted purchasing 1,600 
gallons of black market gasoline 
from George Schanerman, who re- 
cently pleaded guilty to black mar- 
keting in gasoline,

the homes demand occupancy. 
Joseph Platzker, Deputy Housing 
Commissioner and director of the 
City Vacancy Listing Bureau, 1 
East Forty-fourth Street, said yes- 
terday. 

The group includes a veteran of 
the first World War with two sons 
in service and a widow, mother of 
three children, one of whom is 
overseas with the Army. 

Stays of six months, and in some 
cases longer, have expired for the 
families about te be evicted. Mr. 
Platzker said most of them have 
‘no place to go.” There are no 
vacancies at all in Queens and 
Staten Island, he said, and in other 
boroughs apartments are available 
only in slum areas. A bill empow- 
ering courts to grant one year in- 
stead of six-month eviction stays 
was vetoed last week by Governor 
Dewey. 

The evictions due today are only 
a small part of those expected 
shortly, Mr. Platzker said. 

“With 1,318 eviction actions ap- 
proved by the courts during the 
first three months of 1945,” he 
said, “I expect to sce evictions go 
as high as 100 a week during the 
summer.” 

During the first three months of 
1944 the Office of Price Adminis- 
tration approved only 305 eviction 
proceedings. The present situation 
is unprecedented in the city’s his- 
tory, he said. 

Among the families who may be 
evicted today is that of Harry A. 
McCormick, 88-10 215th Street, 
Queens Village. Mr. McCormick 
is a veteran of World War I, Mr. 
Platzker said, has two sons in 





asserting he|..rvice in the Pacific areas, and 


paid $322 for two loads with funds/)... with his wife and a third 


drawn from his personal account. 
He denied visiting Schanerman’s 
station accompanied by Mr. Van 
Riper several months later, as 
Schanerman has testified. 


Ran Station on His Own 


Praml said that after Mr. Van 
Riper became Attorney General in 
January, 1944, he went to the sta- 
tion a few times a week only to 
collect funds for deposit; that he 
(Praml) conducted the business 
without instructions from his em- 
ployers; that he kept no records 
other than the station’s 
book. Several bills and invoices 
addressed to him personally were 
introduced in evidence. 

Hinting at charges made several 
months age by Mr. Van Riper that 
the “indictment was the result of 
a frame-up by Mayor Frank Hague 
of Jersey City in association with 
the national administration,” Sam- 
uel I. Kessler, counsel for Mr. Van 
Riper, said to the jury in his 
opening: 

“You have undoubtedly come to 
the conclusion that this is not just 
an ordinary criminal trial; that it 
has just a little more interest than 
the average case.” 

While referring to the fact that 
the three Federal judges in this| 
district had asked that a jurist) 
from another area be assigned to| 
the case, Judg¢d Knox interrupted | 
him, saying: 

“Let's get along to what you are! 
going to show.” 

Mr. Kessler promised to prove| 
that both Miller and Schanerman, 
the Government’s witnesses, had 
falsified their testimony.

WLB Panel Approves Rates for 
New England Group 


WASHINGTON, April 30 UW»— 
Wage rises of $2.50 a week and 
reduction in progression schedules 
for 12,000 New England telephone 
traffic workers were approved to- 
day by the National Telephone 
Panel of the War Labor Board. 

The ruling is the first by the 
panel since it was authorized to 
make final decisions on voluntary 
applications. 

It approved, as submitted, the 
application of the New England 
Telephone and Telegraph Company, 
based on an agreement with an in- 
dependent union, the New England 
Federation of Telephone Operators. 

Ninety attendants, messengers 
and checkroom workers, as well as 
traffic workers in Maine, Vermont, 
New Hampshire, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, will receive the 
$2.50 increases, which are retro- 
active to Jan. 1.

for Mrs. Anna Moskowitz, 2037 
Fifty-ninth Street, Brooklyn, 
widowed mother of three children, 
one of whom is overseas. 

The families will have no alter- 
native today but to move tempo- 
rarily into slum areas or store 
their furniture and double up with 
friends or relatives. Storage and 
moving companies said they were 
experiencing no sudden great in- 
in storage business but 
added that their moving business 
has decreased tremendously be- 
cause “people have no place to 
move to.” They reported an al- 
most complete absence of “summer 
storage accounts,” which normally 
begin to come in about this time. 
“They all seem to be subletting for 
the summer,” one storage com- 
pany executive said. “Guess they 
want to be sure of a place to come 
back to.” 


2,500 TAX EVASION CASES 


Black Market Operators and War 
Contractors Under Survey 


WASHINGTON, April 30 (P)— 
Twenty-five hundred cases of re- 
ported income tax evasion by black 
marketeers and others are under 
investigation, the Treasury said to- 
night. 

ar contractors “figure in sev- 
eral large cases,” it was stated. 
No indictments were announced, 
but criminal prosecutions and as- 
sessments of millions of dollars in 
taxes and penalties are expected 
to grow out of the anti-evasion 
drive being conducted by 600 
Treasury agents. 

One of the cases was said to 
involve $2,000,000 in additional 
taxes and penalties. The 2,500 
cases are being screened, “with 
first attention being given to cases 
apparently involving large-scale, 
flagrant violations.”

OBEYED FREEZE ORDER 


Fred C. Witty, second vice presi- 
dent of the Chase National Bank, 
testified .before Judge Simon H. 
Rifkind and a jury in the Federal 
court yesterday that the bank of- 
ficials and employes always tried 
to follow the regulations of the 
Presidential freezing order of 
May 10, 1940. 

The bank is on trial on a charge 
of having failed to block the ac- 
count of Anton Smit & Co. of 341 
West Fifty-second Street, an inter- 
national industrial diamond con- 
cern. Under examination by John 
T. Cahill, chief counsel for the de- 
fense, Mr. Witty testified that he 
met Mr. Smit in May or June of 
1940. He declared the account was 
blocked because Mr. Smit’s file in- 
dicated he was a Belgian. On re- 
ceipt of information that the com- 
pany was 95 per cent owned by 
British interests, the account was 
unblocked, the witness declared. 

He described the steps taken by 
bank employes to follow the freeze 
order. He identified memoranda 
concerning the action taken with 
regard to the Smit account. 

The trial will resume at 2:15 
P. M. today.

the Bronx, was stabbed and beaten 
by two unidentified Negroes early 
yesterday on 139th Street between 
Seventh and Eighth Avenues after 
he asked them to pay their $1.50 
cab bill. 

The police said Mr. Brickin drove 
the men, described as young and 
well dressed, from the Pennsyl- 
vania Station to an address on 
139th Street. When they refused 
to pay the bill he got from behind 
the steering wheel and approached 
the men. One man pulled a knife 
from his clothing and stabbed the 
driver in the chest and also in the 
hands. The second man knocked 
him down. Both then fled. Mr. 
Brickin was taken to Harlem Hos- 
pital in a critical condition.

Stop ‘Side Payments’ and 





Smash Illegal Dealings 


By CHARLES GRUTZNER JR. 


The solid front that food retail- 
\ers have maintained for two years 
in refusing to testify 
| wholesale black marketeers for 
fear of reprisals, has been broken 
at last in the poultry trade by the 
{simultaneous signing of affidavits 
by forty retailers, it was learned 
yesterday. 

Rumors of the accusations were 
heard in the poultry markets, 
where they caused excitement, and 
were confirmed by the Office of 
Price Administration. Daniel P. 
Woolley, regional OPA head, said 
the affidavits were being used to 
prepare criminal cases against 
fourteen wholesale houses. 

The signers, all members of a 
Brooklyn retail trade group, de- 
cided at a closed meeting that it 
was better to face the wrath of 
their wholesale suppliers unitedly 
by testifying about black market 
payments exacted from them than 
to be haled to court by the OPA 
and the Department of Markets for 
jretail price violations. 

“This is the first time we’re get- 
ting voluntary cooperation from 
the retailers in a substantial way,” 
said Paul Ross, OPA regional chief 
enforcement attorney. “We hope 
this will help us smash the poultry 
black market through the whole- 
sale level to the commission houses 
and the shippers and all the way 
to the farmers who sell at illegal 
prices.” 


Substance of the Charges 


The affidavits were obtained by 
Albert I. Schmalholz, head of the 
meat, poultry and dairy products 
unit of the New York area OPA. 
He said they covered the sale of 
50,000 pounds a week of fresh- 
killed poultry during the last six 
months and that they presented 
“a uniform pattern” of black mar- 
keting at wholesale. They alleged 
that the wholesalers’ invoices list- 
ed correct weights and ceiling 
prices, but that side payments of 
cash had to be made by the re- 
tailers. 

The side payments, according to 
lthe affidavits, brought the actual 
cost at wholesale to 53 to 60 cents 
a pound, or 18 to 25 cents more 
than the wholesale ceiling price. 

Isadore Fried, chief food enforce- 
ment attorney of the New York 
area OPA, said the evidence would 
be présented to the United States 
Attorney in Brooklyn, where the 
jallegedly illegal sales took place. 
Mr. Fried withheld the name of the 
trade association of which the re- 
tailers are members. Several of 
the accused wholesale concerns do 
a city-wide business. The maxi- 
mum penalty is one year in prison 
and a $5,000 fine for each illegal 
sale. The affidavits alleged hun- 
dreds of separate transactions at 
black-market prices. 

The pre-Easter and pre-Passover 
retail enforcement drives by OPA 
and the Department of Markets, 
when augmented staffs of investi- 
gators served summonses on hun- 
dreds of poultry dealers, was seen 
by the trade as a factor in wearing 
down the reluctance of the retailers 
to testify against their suppliers. 
Several of the signers of the affi- 
davits, who received summonses at 
that time, are awaiting trial. 

Describing the cases being pre- 
pared against the fourteen whole- 
salers as a major blow at the black 
market, Mr. Ross pointed out that 
from July 1, 1944, to March 1 of 
this year OPA had filed a total of 
seventeen cases, involving 173 
counts, against poultry wholesalers 
with the United States Attorneys in 
Manhattan and Brooklyn. He said 
the OPA would ask heavier jail 
sentences and larger fines in the 
cases soon to be brought. 








Supreme Court Aetion Seeks to Declare 
Westchester Toll Act Unconstitutional 


Special to Tos New Yoru Trams, 


ALBANY, April 30—Two mem- 
bers of the Automobile Club of 
New York brought an action in 
Supreme Court here today to have 
the recently enacted Westchester 
Parkways Toll Act declared uncon- 
stitutional. 

Papers were filed in an applica- 
tion for an injunction to restrain 
Frank C. Moore, State Controller, 
and Charles H. Sells, Superintend- 


‘lent of Public Works, from official 


acts leading toward the installa- 
tion of toll gates on the Hutchin- 
son and Saw Mill River Parkways. 
They were filed by Murray, Kis- 
sam & Hayden, New York City at- 
torneys, as counsel for Elmer E. 
Bogart of Westchester and Martin 
Colodny of Queens. 

The Westchester tolls law pro- 
vides an appropriation of $2,500,- 
000 for reimbursement of the Fed- 
eral Government for moneys con- 
tributed by it toward construction 
of the parkways. The money will 
be advanced in the first instance 
by the State, but reimbursement 
will be made by Westchester Coun- 
ty to the State. Reimbursement of 
the Federal Government was held 
necessary because highways built 
wholly or in part with Federal 
funds must remain toll free. 

Bogart and Colodney, describing 
themselves as taxpayers and auto- 
mobile owners, contended through 
their attorneys that the due proc- 
ess provisions of both the State 
and Federal constitutions were vio- 
lated by the tolls law and that the 
charging of tolls on the parkways 
also would be contrary to the pro- 
visions of the Federal Road Aid 
Act. 

The Bogart-Colodney complaint 


was accompanied by a copy of a 
certificate, signed in 1922 by Gov. 
Nathan L. Miller, under which 
funds for construction and recon- 
struction of the two parkways lat- 
er were granted in accordance 
with the Federal Highway Act. 

The plaintiffs allege that West- 
chester County, the State and the 
United States Public Roads Ad- 
ministration entered into an illegal 
agreement to get around the Fed- 
eral rule against charging of tolls 
on routes constructed with help of 
Federal funds. 

William J. Gottlieb, president of 
the State Automobile Association, 
said a novel question hag been pre- 
sented to the court and that this 
was the first time an effort was 
made ‘to change a free way into 
a tell route by legislation.” 

Special to THe New Yorx Times, 

WHITE PLAINS, N. Y., April 
30—Although none of the West- 
chester County officials here was 
served with papers in the suit to 
invalidate the tolls, William A. 
Davidson, county attorney, said 
this afternoon that he would go to 
Albany later this week and enter 
the litigation in some capacity to 
seek its defeat. 

He declared that county officials 
welcomed the suit so that a final 
adjudication of the legal questions 
could be obtained before the tolls 
become operative next Feb. 1 and 
before the county compiled with a 
provision of the toll bill that re- 
quires repayment of $2,500,000 to 
; the Federal Government for money 
spent on Westchester parkways 
under the old NIRA.

Court Reserves Decision on Demand for 
Recapture of Instruments So Those on 


Waiting List Can Use Them 


Supreme Court Justice David W., 


|Peck reserved decision yesterday 


'14 CONCERNS ARE ACCUSED | 


Criminal Actions Planned to 


in a mandamus proceeding in 
which Leon Leighton, an attorney, 


lsought to compel the New York 


Telephone Company to remove, ex- 
cept in certain eases, all residen- 


jtial telephones “in excess of one to 
jeach resident” 
ments might be used by 75,000 ap-| 


so that the instru- 


plicants who now are unable to 


jobtain telephones. 


Mr. Leighton informed the court 
that last fall he applied for a tele- 
phone in his residence at 25 Mad- 
den Road, Scarsdale, 
was advised that the shortage of 


ling 


N. Y., but] 


maintained control of the alloca- 
tion of telephone equipment, that 
the court should not interfere with 
such control and that Mr. Leighton 
had “adequate remedy” before the 
Public Service Commission. 

A statement issued by the com- 
pany said: 

“The Federal Government and 
the telephone industry have over a 
long period of time considered all 
possible ways and means of reliev- 
the shortage of telephone 
facilities caused by the lack of 
central office switchboard equip- 
ment, telephone instruments and 
wire plant. Every method that has 
been deemed practical has been 





against |instruments would not permit in- 


stallation. 

His complaint said that “the 
number of additional instruments 
in residences in excess of one in- 
strument to each resident has sub- 





stantially exceeded the number of 
instruments required by respondent 
in order to render telephone serv- 
ice to those who are presently 
without such service solely because 
of the lack of instruments.” 

Mr. Leighton informed the court 


adopted. 

“Up to the present time the 
|Government’s conclusion, with 
which the telephone company is 
in complete agreement, has been 
that recapture of residence exten- 
sion telephones would be undesir- 
able. Such a plan would take away 
from individuals something they 
have had for along time and would 
|be a form of rationing which the 
|Government has as a rule avoided.” 
| The statement said that the 





that in December he had demanded 


WPB restriction on the manufac- 


that the telephone company recap-|ture of central office equipment 
ture a “sufficient number of these| was the bottleneck for 70 per cent 
instruments,” but the company re-|of unfilled orders, and that a new 
j|fused because “the whole theory of | regulation permits manufacturers 


the rationing program has been not 


to deprive anyone of what he pres-| 


ently has, but merely to allocate 
items which become avail- 
able.” 

The attorney charged that the 
telephone company is in violation 
of subdivisions three and one of 
Section 91 of the Public Service 
Law; and in violation of its com- 
mon law obligation as a_ public 
service corporation. 

Replying to Mr. Leighton’s 
charges, the company, through its 
counsel, Ralph W. Brown, argued 
that the War Production Board 


WFA CALLS MEETING 
ON HOSPITAL POULTRY 


War Food Administration and 
city officials will meet today at the 
WEA office, 150 Broadway, to dis- 
cuss ways of supplying the dietary 
requirements of hospitals for poul- 
try. 

The WFA declined yesterday to 
comment, in advance of the meet- 
ing, on criticism by City Purchase 
Commissioner Albert Pleydell of 
WFA for not having made avail- 
able to hospitals the six-tenths 
pound of poultry a patient a week 
that it had established two months 
ago as a minimum for hospitals. 

Mr. Pleydell said the regional 

WFA had failed to invoke the 
mandatory priority that the Wash- 
ington WFA had allowed hospitals, 
but had sought instead to obtain 
supplies of poultry for hospitals 
from the trade on a voluntary 
basis. He joined with the Greater 
New York Hospital Association in 
charging that the voluntry system 
had proved a failure. 
Mr. Pleydell said the six-tenths 
pound minimum would permit a 
hospital to serve a poultry meal 
once in two weeks. For the city 
hospitals, he said, this would re- 
quire 12,000 pounds a week, but 
actual receipts had been only one- 
tenth of that. 


FINDS FOR PATENT SUITS 


Supreme Court Points Recourse 
to Party in Denial of Grant 





Special to Tus New Yorx Tiuams. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—In its 
only written opinion handed down 
today, the Supreme Court held that 
a person to whom a patent has 
been refused might sue in a Fed- 
eral District Court. This finding, 
by Justice Owen J. Roberts, re- 
versed a decision by the local Fed- 
eral Court of Appeals. That tri- 
bunal had supported the Commis- 
sioner of Patents in refusing a pat- 
ent to the Hoover Company on a 
refrigerating system because all 
of the claims had not been stated 
in the application. 

The Supreme Court designated 
May 28 as its likely adjournment 
date for the summer, but it was 
not felt that this goal could be 
attained, in view of the number of 
cases pending on the docket. The 
court ordered that arguments on 
cases be closed this week. The 
justices will reet next Monday to 
hand down opinions and then re- 
cess until May 21. 

Some fifty cases still are to be 
disposed of, and if the court ex- 
pects to deal with most of them, it 
is probable that its term will be ex- 
tended into June. 


TWO ATTORNEYS LOSE 


Their Convictions for Contempt 
at Sedition Trial Are Upheld 


WASHINGTON, April 30 (®)— 
The Circuit Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia today up- 
held two convictions for contempt 
during the mass sedition trial and 
reversed a third. 

Reversed was the conviction by 
the late Chief Justice Edward C. 
Eicher, presiding at the trial of 
Henry H. Klein of New York, who 
had been sentenced to ninety days 
in jail for quitting as a defense 
counsel without the court’s permis- 
sion. 

The Appellate Court upheld con- 
victions of James J. Laughlin, an- 
other defense lawyer, and of Ellis 
O. Jones, a defendant who repre- 
sented himself at the trial. Mr. 
Laughlin had been fined $150 and 
Mr. Jones $100. 

Mt. Wilson to ‘Mt. Roosevelt’ 

DENVER, April 30 (UP)—Gov- 
ernor Vivian announced today that 
14,250-foot Mount Wilson will be 
re-named in honor of the late 
President Roosevelt. The moun- 
tain is one of two peaks in the 
State named after President Wil- 
son. The 
sent a letter to the United States 
Board of Geographic Names ask- 
ing that the mountain be officially 
designated as Mount Franklin 
Roosevelt. 


Governor said he has| 


to produce new instruments to the 
limit of available material and 
| manpower. 

The statement added that “the 
company does not wish to imply 
that liberalization of the instru- 
ment manufacturing authorization 
will allow it to install service 
shortly for all those whose orders 
are held because of instrument 
shortage only.” It declared also 
that “with the change in the man- 
ufacturing situation it now seems 
less desirable than ever to embark 
jon a residence extension recap- 
ture program.” 





$27 Bid for Steamship 

Awash in Waters of Bay 

The Department of Purchase 
received just one bid yesterday 
—and that for only $27—for the 
364-ton, twin screw steamer 
Colonel Clayton, which cost 
$200,000 when she was built 
twenty-six years ago for the 
Army. The catch is that the 
steamer now lies awash in the 
waters of Flushing Bay at Four- 
teenth Avenue, College Point, 
Queens, and will have to be 
raised by the purchaser. 

The $27 was submitted by 
Patrick McCarthy, a former 
dredge captain for the city, who 
is now a shipyard plant fore- 
man in Jersey City, N. J. He 
does not know what he wiil do 
with the vessel if the city ac- 
cepts his bid, but he is prepared 
to spend $6,000 to raise her. 








‘FENCE’ SENT TO PRISON 


His Wife ‘Receives Suspended 
Sentence in Jewelry Case 


Joseph Cuffori, 45 years old, a 
former small-time horse race book- 
maker, was sentenced yesterday to 
Sing Sing for two to four years as 
the “fence” for most of the $23,000 
in jewelry that two young burglars 
stole last October from Mrs. Marie 
K. Schofield’s suite at 778 Park 
Avenue. ‘His wife, Helen, 27, was 
let off with a suspended peniten- 
tiary sentence by Judge Jacob 
Gould Schurman Jr. She pur- 
chased $17,000 of the jewelry 
from an intermediary, which she 
returned at the District Attorney’s 
office last February. Her sentence 
was for a misdemeanor. 

The intermediary, Andrew For- 
ray, 29, of 26 Broadway, Jersey 
City, N. J., is to be sentenced to- 
day. All three had pleaded guilty. 
The Cufforis bought the jewelry 
from Forray in their home at 318 
East Sixty-ninth Street, after one 
of the young burglars, William 
Minarovitch, 16, involved Forray 
in the disposal of the loot. The 
youth had boasted of his participa- 
tion in the burglary in the Cox- 
sackie Reformatory up-State, to 
which he had been committed as 
an automobile thief after the loot- 
ing of the suite. 


WMC DROPS TIRE ‘DRAFT’ 


New Bedford Textile Workers 
Needed for War Fabrics 


Special to Tus New Yorx Trouxs. 


BOSTON, April 30—The War 
Manpower Commission abandoned 
today its efforts to draft New Bed- 
ford, Mass., textile workers for 
|jobs in two tire cord mills and dis- 
missed without prejudice the ap- 
peals of workers who refused to 
obey the transfer edict. 

Arthur C. Gernes, WMC region- 
al director, said that the WMC had 
dropped the forced labor draft be- 
cause the Federal Government had 
placed orders for 16,000,000 yards 
of critical fabrics in the fine goods 
cotton mills of New Bedford. He 
said that the fine goods mills 
would be required 'to retain all 
their workers. Heretofore, the 
Fisk and Firestone tire cord mills 
have been the top priority war in- 
dustry of the city. 

A sharp rise in military orders 
for use in the Pacific campaign in- 
volves twenty-nine fabrics, includ- 
ing airplane and glider and jungle 
cloth, insect netting, wind resistant 
cottons and cambric for insulation.

IS HELD UNLIKELY 


State Controller Declares He 


Knows No Plan or Method 
to Decrease Rates 


OUTLINES NEW PROGRAM 


‘Property Owners’ Group Hears 
of Plan for Shared Relief 
Costs Under State Aid 


Frank C. Moore, State Control- 
ler, outlining the major provisions 
jof a new tax program that soon 
| will be considered by a special ses- 
sion of the Legislature, admitted 
to real estate operators here yes- 
terday that he knew of no plan 
or method that would succeed in 
reducing tax rates. 

Mr. Moore, who also is the chair- 
man of the Temporary State Com- 
mission of Municipal Revenues and 
Reduction of Real Estate Taxes, 
told 100 members of the Property 
Owners Committee of the Com- 
merce and Industry Association of 
New York, Inc., at the Hotel Com- 
modore that as long as municipali- 
ties differ in every respect, “no 
man has the wisdom to come out 
with a solution ‘or all.” 

“I tell you now,” he continued, 
“there is no fancy gadget or legis- 
lation to determine how much each 
community should get in the form 
of tax relief. You may not like to 
hear it, but I want you to know 
that I do not believe an assess- 
ment review is the solution to mu- 
nicipal finances. Review is no cure 
because cities differ like indi- 
viduals.” r 


Sharing of Service Costs 


The Controller, however, said 
further study was needed and ex- 
pressed the opinion that the costs 
of local services such as social and 
welfare should be assumed by all 
forms of wealth in the State and 
not merely real estate. 

The new tax program which the 
special session will consider pro- 
poses that the State assume a 
larger share of relief costs and re- 
place the present system of shared 
taxes with stable annual grants. 
This modernization of the system 
of State aid to municipalities and 
local governments includes all pur- 
poses except education. 

Each community under the new 
plan, he explained, would get a flat 
sum annually, while local expenses 
would be stabilized by shifting to 
the State the Government services 
that fluctuate. In the fields of 
social welfare, he said, the State 
should take over a larger share of 
the burden than it has in home 
relief, assistance to the blind, old 
age assistance and help to depend- 
ent children. 

Communities would assume 20 
per cent of the burden, while the 
State would supply all additional 
funds not taken into account by 
Federal grants, ae continued. 

Mr. Moore said the State tried to 
assist communities to meet their 
tax requirements through budge- 
tary aids for education, highways, 
relief and welfare services and 
public health. He also cited the 
system of shared taxation, terming 
this, however, “the most cockeyed 
ever heard.” 

“Tt is unstable because when the 
need is the greatest the municipal- 
ities get the least and that is the 
only stable thing about it,” he de- 
clared. “There is no relationship 
to the needs of the community 
under this system.” 

He said that in the future mu- 
nicipalities must study other 
sources of income than their pres- 
ent ones and he mentioned as one 
possibility the provision of special 
services to suburban areas at the 
proper cost. 


Difference in Valuation 


Criticizing existing tax limita- 
tions in cities over 100,000, Mr. 
Moore pointed to the fact that 
they all did not supply the same 
services even though they had the 
same limitations. In addition, he 
said cities did not all assess on the 
same tax valuation and cited Troy, 
where the tax rate is $8 higher 
than any place else. 

“After the plan goes into effect,” 
he predicted, “it will merely be the 
start. Then it will be necessary to 
make individual studies. But until 
the plan is in effect there is no 
foundation and no way of planning. 
It offers unprecedented opportuni- 
ties to plan local fiscal policies.” 

Other States throughout the na- 
tion are watching to see what New 
York does before taking action on 
similar problems, Mr. Moore said, 
estimating that if the plan had 
been in effect this year New York 
State could have had a large sav- 
ing to be used at a time when 
needed. 

One other point stressed by the 
controller was that the State never 
should undertake through shared 
taxes or similar devices to “indem- 
nify taxpayers of the mistakes 
made by their chosen local offi- 
cials.” He explained after his ad- 
dress that he was not referring to 
any specific city. He also said that 
his commission had not considered 
Mayor La Guardia’s proposal for a 
1 per cent sales tax to aid the local 
transportation system, but that it 
might come up in the future. 


Woman’s Murder Trial Begins 

Mrs. Katherine ioran, 45 years 
old, went on trial yesterday before 
Judge Thomas Downs in Queens 
County Court under the first de- 
gree murder indictment 4 
that she shot and killed her hus- 
band, Patrolman James R. Horan, 
in their Far Rockaway home last 
Feb. 7. The jurors, all married men, 
were selected. The two women 
called on the panel were excused. 
Attorney James D. C. Murray in- 
dicated that the defense may be 
temporary emotional insanity 
brought on by an alleged series of 
acts of disloyalty by Mrs. Horan’s 
husband.

Gottesman Tells Bar Group 
‘Across-the-Board’ Activities 
Are Essential 


WORK WILL BE BROADENED 


To Tighten Up in Enforcing 
MPR-580—Especially Names 
House Furnishings 


In an apparent answer to Fed- 
eral Judge Murray Hulbert, who 
recently took the enforcement di- 
vision of the Office of Price Ad- 
ministration to task for concern- 
ing itself too much with “nones- 
sentials,’ Callman Gottesman, 


that military requirements, which|New York chapter, at a meeting|chief enforcement attorney for the 


are greater than at any time dur- 
ing the war, and essential civilian 
needs have placed a continuing 
heavy burden on the textile indus- 
try. 

“We should produce five yards 
of wool and cotton textiles for ev- 
ery four yards now being pro- 
duced,” Mr. Krug declared, “and 
we should also increase synthetic 
textile production substantially.” 

To bring about the increase in 
fabrics needed to boost production 
up to the peak levels of 1942 and 
1943, WPB has drawn up a pro- 
gram, in cooperation with the 
Army, Navy, War Manpower Com- 
mission, WLB, Selective Service 
and the OPA. 

The program is to be submitted 
to the woolen and worsted manu- 
facturers industry advisory com- 


mittee at a meeting here tomor-| 


row 

Pointigg out that military re- 
quirements will continue to rise, 
Mr. Krug, in a letter to all textile 
producers, stated: 

“It is up to you, in industry, to 


give the answer this time. Most} 
lls are presently operating below | 


et 
their 1942 rate of production. This 
rate must be restored. There are 
many factors favorable to an in- 
crease in production at this mo- 
ment. In some areas workers are

INDUSTRY AAMT 
_ EFFECTS OF H-388 


‘Measure Becomes Operative 


Today but Over-All Results Still 
Are Obscure, Trades Say 





Marking what was described as 
the “greatest experiment” in the 


| textile and apparel fields since%the 


agency, declared last night that 


if the agency’s control over prices 
is to be effective, its enforcement 
activities must be “across the 
board” and not confined to foods. 

As part of the “across-the-board” 
activities, he disclosed a vigorous 
campaign is being undertaken to 
tighten the controls on house fur- 
nishings. He added that OPA will 
seek promptly injunctions against 
violators of the MPR-580. 

“Economics, like the law, is a 
seamless web,”’ Mr. Gottesman told 
a Federal Bar Association OPA 
symposium at the United States 
Court House, “and failure to have 
price control in one part of the 
economy reflects itself in other 
parts of the economy.” 

The symposium was held under 
the auspices of the Federal Bar 
Association of New York, New 
Jersey and Connecticut. 

While Mr. Gottesman did not re- 
fer specifically to Judge Hulbert, 
many of the members attending 
the meeting associated his re- 
marks with a reprimand given 
early last month by Judge Hul- 
bert in an OPA case involving 
overcharges in the sale of bed- 
springs. He castigated the agency 
for concerning itself with such 
“non-essentials”’ as bedsprings, wo- 
men’s slips and toys to the disre- 


being released from other forms of |Start of the war, M-388, the War! gard of food cases.

“The War Production Board is|

within our power to assist the War 
Manpower Commission in meeting} 


your labor needs, but the final an- 
swer is up to you. We must count 
on management 
the job to provide the increased 
production needed for early and 
complete victory.” 

OPA announced simultaneously 
that five newly organized industry 
advisory committees from the wo- 
men's garment field will meet with 
agency officials during the first 
week in May in Washington. The 
committees represent manufactur- 
ers of wash dresses and dresses of 
other price ranges.

{Production Board regulation de- 
signed to channel textiles into 
jlower end and medium-price gar- 
|ments, becomes effective today. 
While the garment trades, prac- 
tically unanimously, have opposed 
the order on many grounds, major 
interest yesterday was said to cen- 
jter on the following phases of the 
regulation: 
| Whether sufficient fabrics will 
|be available to honor the AA-4 
|priorities, the corollary question of 





|how much free goods would actu- 
ally be found to sustain the pro- 
|duction of better grade garments 
jabove the cut-off points, the ex- 
jtent to which black-market opera- 
jtions might increase and, finally, 
|from the retailer's standpoint, how 
|much would his allotments of fall 
|garments shrink as compared with 
last year. 

No one had the answer to these 
questions yesterday and the belief 
was expressed that at least sev- 
eral weeks will be required for 
operation of the plan before a more 
or less definite idea can be for- 
jmulated on the success, or lack of 
it, of M-388. Moreover, MAP be- 
gins to function in June and forms 
an essential part of the over-all 
control. 

With M-388 effective the flow of 
textiles from the mill and convert- 
jer to the cutter is governed by the 
|AA-4 priorities, the categories as 
jlisted and the cut-off points. The 
flow of “free goods,” those remain- 
ing after priorities, is cut down to 
|a fraction of the former amounts. 
This cutting down of the amount 
|of free goods, plus the elimination 
of many so-called non-essential 
items from priority assistance, 
were cited as the chief immediate 
results of the regulation. In an- 
ticipation of this situation, cut- 
ters-up during recent weeks sought 
| to obtain as much free goods for 
inventory as was possible. How- 
jever, the amount obtained, it was 
|said, was very small in relation to

Mr. Gottesman pointed out that 
‘Gnflationary pressures are most 
contagious.” While food retail 
prices remained fairly stable from 
May, 1943, to December, 1944, he 
said, clothing costs rose 11.6 per 
cent and home furnishings 14.3 per 
cent. “Valiant efforts” are being 
made by OPA and WPB to hold 
the line in clothing prices and 
‘house furnishings, he declared. 

“I mention this,” he continued, 
“because some courts have given 
fines rather than jail sentences in 
criminal cases involving textiles 
and housefurnishings, stating that 
enforcement activities should be 

ely confined to food cases.” 

ag oe to MPR-580, the retail 
regulation which establishes prices 
on the basis of the margins of the 
individual seller on March 19, 1945, 
and requires each retailer affected 
to file a pricing chart, Mr. Gottes- 
man said that “we will seek in- 
junctions, among other things, to 
compel compliance with this pro- 
vision and a similar provision re- 
quiring filing of charts showing 
base period weighted average 
prices in MAP by May 31. 

“The real teeth in MAP lie in 
the provision which requires a sell- 
er who exceeds his maximum av- 
erage price during a quarter in any 
category to go on a make-up op- 
eration with respect to all cate- 
gories until the make-up period is 
over—that is, until the seller has 
sold enough items below his max- 
imum average price to even up the 
amount (units plus price) sold 
above the maximum average price 
in the previous quarter. 

“Any sale above the maximum 
average price during the make-up 
period is a violation and we intend 
to bring prompt injunction and 
treble-damage actions in such 
cases.” 

John F. X. McGohey, United 
States Attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, also spoke 
at the meeting. The Hon. John 
Bright, United States District 
Court judge, presided.

The New Pork Cimes 
OFFICIAL DEFENDS ‘RED HERRING’ DATA 


BRING SBC WARNING 


Agency Says It Will Not Speed 
Registration of Securities if 
Prospectus Is Faulty 


IMPROPER REPORTS CITED 


Preliminary Guide to Dealers 
Held to Call for Notice of 
Subsequent Changes 


Special to Tux New Yorn Times. 

PHILADELPHIA, April 30—In 
a pronouncement concerning re- 
quests for acceleration of the ef- 
fective date of registration state-| 
ments, the Securities and Ex-| 
change Commission warned today 
that it would not expedite a regis- 
tration if a “red herring’ pro- 
spectus had been circulated in a 





form that failed to meet require- 
ments of the Securities Act. 

A “red herring” prospeccus is 
used often by companies to inform 
dealers of a forthcoming issue. 
Along the left-hand border of each 
page of such preliminary state- 
ment is a notation printed in red 
that the information “is subject to 
correction and change without 
notice.” On occasion such pro- 
spectuses have been changed so 
greatly by the time the registra- 
tion became effective that the 
original material has been “inac- 
curate and inadequate,” it was 
said, 

Section 8 (A) of the act pro- 
vides, the commission pointed out, 
that the “effective date of a regis- 
tration statement shall be the 
twentieth day after the filing 
thereof, or such earlier date ag the 
commission may deterimne, having 
due regard to the adequacy of the 
information respecting the issue 
theretofore available to the public 
and to the protection of investors.” 

The statutory standards of the 
section have not been met, the 
commission declared, in a case 
“where a ‘red herring’ prospectus 
which was inaccurate or inade- 
quate in material respects has 
been circulated.” 

Accordingly, the SEC added, 
“the commission will not order ac- 
celeration in such a case until it 
has received satisfactory assurance 
that by appropriate means the na- 
ture of the material amendments 
to the registration statement have 
been communicated to those per- 
sons to whom the ‘red herring’ 
prospectus was distributed.”

WICHITA, Kan., April 30 
The huge Hugoton field of Kan- 
sas and Oklahoma, one of the 
world’s largest known gas re- 
serves, has been declared a “re- 
stricted” area, effective on May 
1, by the Petroleum Administra- 
tor for War. 

Theo A. Morgan, conservation 
director of the Kansas Corpora- 
tion Commission, said today that 
under the new order, received 
from the Chicago office of the 
PAW, no materials may be used 
to drill or complete any well un- 
less drilling was started prior to 
May 1 or specifically is author- 
ized by the Petroleum Adminis- 
trator for War. Signed by E. J. 
Bullock, director in charge of 
District 2, the order gives PAW 
control of all drilling in the 
field.

APRIL'S STOCK RISE 


BIGGEST SINCE 1939) 


Upturn Largest for Any Month |since January and for an 


Since Beginning of the War 
—Bonds Also Gain 


Although the volume of trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange 
last month expanded only slightly 


over that of the previous 


and the coresponding month in 


1944, the turnover of 127,366,175 


shares thus far 
largest in eight years, or since 
1937. Sales exceeded two million 
shares in two sessions in April and 
transactions of 2,504,310 shares on 
April 16 were the heaviest for any 
Session in ten months. 

Sales last month, as compiled by 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, amounted 
to 28,270,442 shares, compared 
with 27,492,243 in March and 13,- 
846,590 in April, 1944. 

Stocks were at their best levels 
in eight years and the average had 
the widest monthly gains since 
September, 1939, the first month of 
the war. Prices advanced through- 
out the month, with the exception 
of a few minor s&backs. The rail 
average at 44.23 on April 30 was 
at the highest point since mid-June 
of 1937 and the combined averages 
at 118.94 on the same day were at 
their best levels since Sept. 16, 
1937. 

The gain of 9.46 points in the 
combined averages was the widest 
f any month since September, 
1939; it brought the increase for 
the year to date to 12.86 points. 

Transactions in stocks for April 
and from Jan. 1 this year compare

HIGH COURT CLOSES | 
L. l. LIGHTING CASE: 


Dismisses SEC Petition for 
Stay Against Completion of |c 
Plan for New Set-Up 


WASHINGTON, April 30 (P—!| 
T..e Supreme Court dismissed to- 
day a petition of the Securities and| 
Exchange Commission involving a 
recapitalization plan of the Long 
Island Lighting Company. 

The SEC, in a suit in lower 
courts, sought to enjoin the con- 
cern, a New York holding com- 
pany, from completing the plan 
under New York State law. The 
SEC desired a stay in proceedings 

nding a determination by it 
whether rights of stockholders 

ould be subject to reorganiza-| 
tion standards of the Public Util-| 
ity Holding Company Act. 

The New York Federal District 
Court refused to issue an injunc- 
tion on the ground that it lacked 
jurisdiction. The Second Federal 
Circuit Court upheld this finding 
and SEC appealed to the Supreme 
Court. 

The high tribunal, in dismissing 
the petition, announced merely 
that the case had become moot— 
thet is, that there is now no fur- 
ther cause for court action. It or- 
dered the judgment of the Circuit 
Court vacated and told the Dis- 


rie 





COMMODITIES 


trict Court to dismiss the com- 
plaint of the sec. 


Company Filed led Registration 


Termination of the protracted 
| struggle of the Long Island Light- 
ing Company to resist the authori- 
ty of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission occurred on April 23, 
when the company filed a registra- 
tion as a holding company with the 
SEC under the Holding Company 
Act of 1935. 

This action was taken by the 
company two days after a sharp 
attack on the security structure of 
the company and its affiliates by 
the SEC in an order terminating 
an exemption which it had granted 
the company in 1936. This move 
by the SEC restored to it the power 
to modify the company’s capital 
structure in any way it deems nec- 
essary in the public interest, it was 
declared. 

Although the New York Public 
Service Commission had approved 
the reorganization plan in Decem- 
ber, 1944, all properties of the com- 
pany being within this State and 
under its jurisdiction, the SEC ex- 
pressed doubt that the plan could 
satisfy the “fair and equitable” re- 
quirement of the Holding Company 
Act or that the structure proposed 
could be approved under the stand- 
ards set by the act. 


Banker Names Assistant 

Arthur S. Kleeman, president 
of the Colonial Trust Company, 
announced yesterday the appoint- 
ment of John C. Jester of Dallas, 
Tex., as his assistant. Mr. Jester 
will have charge of Coloniaf’s rela- 
tions with Texas banks.

DEFERRED MONTHS 
LEAD WHEAT RISE 


Futures Rally After an Early 
Break—Rye and Corn Up 
—Oats Irregular 


Special to Taz New York Times. 
CHICAGO, April 30—Grain mar- 
kets continued today to fluctuate 
in a nervous manner and there was 
considerable evening up, attributed 
to persistent peace talk. Wheat fu- 
tures moved in a range of around 
2 cents a bushel and rallied quick- 
ly after an early break to close 
% to 1% cents a bushel higher 
than Saturday’s closing prices. The 
deferred deliveries led the upturn. 

Rye was unsettled but finished 
% to 1 cent higher, May leading. 
Corn and oats were dull, corn 
finishing % to % cent higher and 
oats %& cent lower to % cent high- 
er, Barley was unchanged to % 
cent higher. 

Short covering and buying at- 
tributed to a leading professional 
trader were largely responsible for 
the strength in wheat futures. Re- 
ports that the Government would 
take 20 per cent or more of the 
flour produced by American mills 
was held to indicate that mills 
would have to buy large quantities 
of cash wheat. 

The visible supply decreased 
4,984,000 bushels last week and 
was 63,150,000, compared with 68,- 
134,000 the previous week and 
111,004,000 last year. Less favor- 
able crop comments from Kansas, 
Oklahoma and Texas also had some 
effect on the market. 

Primary receipts of wheat ag- 
gregated 2,038,000 bushels, against 
1,513,000 last week and 1,904,000 
last year. Shipments were 901,000 
bushels, compared with 983,000 a 
week ago and 1,105,000 a year ago. 

Corn held within relatively nar- 
row price limits, with short cov- 
ering and commission house buy- 
ing, based on strength in other 
grains, the main influences. The 
country sold 500,000 bushels of 
cash corn for thirty-day shipment, 
buyers offering ceiling prices. 

The visible supply decreased 
862,000 bushels last week and was 
16,681,000, against 17,543,000 last 
week and 8,180,000 last year. Pri- 
mary points received 2,542,000 
bushels, compared with 2,306,000 
a week ago and 418,000 a year ago. 
Shipments were 1,096,000 bushels, 
against 1,045,000 last week and 
96,000 last year. 

Tenders of 1,985,000 bushels of 
cash rye on May contracts failed 
to have any effect on the market. 
Professional operations dominated. 
Local stocks of rye decreased 375,- 
000 bushels last week, but the 
visible supply was up 23,000 bush- 
els. 

Oats and barley followed other 
grains, with scattered liquidation 
in May oats. 

Prices for the principal grains 
were as follows:

norma! inventory requirements for 
many producers. 

Meanwhile, retailers are keenly 
desirous of placing orders for fall 
merchandise, particularly ‘“back- 
to-school” items which are chiefly 
represented in early retail offer- 
ings of fall goods. Some business 
is being booked and some more 
will be booked during the period 
from May 15 to June 1, but the | 
total will run well under last year 
and prove far less than in 1943. 
The point was made that the size 
of retailers’ buying budgets for 
fall will be no criterion of retail 
fall stocks of apparel. 


RAYONIER GETS LOAN

to Be Taken by Institutions 


Arrangements have been com- 
pleted by Rayonier Incorporated,

Bartsch, president. Four banks

with the Mutual Life Insurance 
Company of New York taking the

used in part to refund an existing 
term loan and to meet obligations 
incurred in connection with the 
recent purchase of timberlands and 
logging equipment of the Bloedel 
Donovan Lumber Mills in Clallam

SUPPORT BY TRADE 
STEADIES COTTON 


Close Is Up 1 to 4 Points, With 
May Delivery Leading, After 
Decline at Opening 


Led by firmness in the May de- 
livery, the futures market on the 
New York Cotton Exchange closed 
yesterday 1 to 4 points higher than 
Saturday's final levels. 

The market opened unchanged 
to 4 points lower, hesitated for a 
time, then steadied on trade sup- 
port. There was some buying on 
the belief that V-E Day, although 
not officially announced, had been 
discounted. 

The Commodity Credit Corpora- 
jtion’s 1944 loan program termi- 
nated yesterday, but the purchase 
program will continue through 
June 30. 

The Cotton Belt forecast was for 
mostly fair and warmer weather, 
a condition urgently needed in 
most areas, 

The Department of Agriculture 
announced yesterday that the mid- 
April parity for cotton was un- 
changed at 21.45 cents a pound.
