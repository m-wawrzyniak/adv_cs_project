the action that decided

trated by the fact that the Ameri-

along easier roads got stuck in the 
snow until Norwegian chauffeurs, 
accustomed driving, were 
able to bring it to the front 

At same time, the German 
trooy in Trondheim, which have 
been steadily reinforced by air, are 
already strong enough only to

to attack the French and Nor- 
lines both sides of

At Narvik, on the other hand, the

gian soldiers taken prisoners have 
reached Sweden in a half-starved

had been released by the Germans 
because of the desperate food

‘BRITAIN URGED TO END 
WELCOMED IN EGYPT BREACH WITH MEXICO 


Volanteers Will Be Split Up in Bar to Oil Railing Reich by 


Way of Italy Is Motive 


Special Cable to Tue New Yorn Times 

LONDON, April 30—Replying to a 
suggestion that Great Britain should 
resume diplomatic relations with 
Mexico to prevent that country 
from selling gasoline to Italy for re- 
export to Germany, Richard Austen 
Butler, Under-Secretary for For- 
eign Affairs, told the House of 
Commons today that while Italians 
were buying large quantities of 
petroleum from Mexico there was 
no evidence that it was being passed 
on to the Nazis. 

As to Anglo-Mexican diplomatic 
relations, Mr. Butler said, the gov- 
ernment ‘‘still are desirous of secur- 
ing a settlement of the oil dispute 
with Mexico on a reasonable basis, 
but they are satisfied that the 
chances of the Italian Government 
re-exporting oil to Germany would 
not in any way be affected by such 
a settlement.” 

Relations between Britain and 
Mexico were broken. off in 1938 
when Mexico expropriated oil prop- 
erty previously owned by British 
and United States companies. 

The government repudiated a sug- 
gestion that war interests were be- 
ing sacrificed to satisfy the inter- 
ests of British oil companies. 


Wireless to THE,NeEW YorkK Trmes 

MEXICO CITY, April 30—Foreign 
Minister Eduardo Hay had a long 
interview with President Lazaro 
Cardenas this morning and it is 
presumed Mexico's reply to Secre 
tary of State Cordeli Hull's note on 
the oil question was thoroughly 
discussed.

Special Cable to THe New York Times 

MADRID, April 30—Faced with a 
serious shortag wheat, the gov- 
ernment today halved the bread ra- 
tion, reducing the daily amount per 
person from 250 to 125 grams. This 
was accomplished by a decree for- 
bidding bakeries to sell bread ex- 
cept on alternate days, the amount 
available for each purchaser re- 
maining unchanged. 

Heavy rains in

recent months

of the new crop of wheat in Castile, 
but drowned out a considerable por-

ever, it is understood that 
has refused to provide more than 
the 175,000 tons authorized by the 
recent commercial treaty, and the 
lack of shipping is holding up sup 
plies from the Argentine—which 
granted a credit of 400,000 tons 
and from Australia. Portugal and 
Yugoslavia have been approached, 
but have little or none to spare, and 
It is understood that the govern- 
ment has now made overtures to 
buy wheat in the United States 

There is also a shortage of chick 
peas and red beans, two staple 
foods of the poor, and the govern- 
ment is looking around for outside 
sources to supply the need. There 
is, fortunately, plenty of fruit and 
green vegetables, but a strict ra- 
tioning of sugar, olive oil, potatoes, 
milk, chick peas and beang. Meat is 
available about once a mbnth and 
butter not at all.

mons were disappointed today in 
the failure of Prime Minister Cham- 
berlain to make a statement on the 
progress of the war since the in- 
vasion of Scandinavia. They are 
prepared for the glocmiest account 
of events there on Thursday, when 
the Prime Minister is expected to 
let the people in on the bad news. 
Older members are comparing the 
results of the Norwegian campaign 
with the disastrous Gallipoli adven- 
ture in the World War. 

In all this atmosphere of gloom 
pervading this blacked-out capital, 
there was an overtone of important 
domestic and foreign developments, 
all stemming from what has been 
happening in the last fortnight 
across the North Sea. These spec- 
ulations feli into two categories. 

The first and most important was

It would be premature to suggest 
that violent re- 
action first place, 
and Arthur 
leaders of the Labor

Affirms Guilt of All Germans 


Mr. Chamberlain told the Com- 
mons that the British Government 
had changed its attitude that 
while the Allies had no vindictive 
designs against the German people, 
the latter must recognize that ‘‘the 
responsibility for 
war and the sufferings it might 
bring is theirs as well as that of 
the Nazi tyrants who stand over 
them

Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Liberal 
leader, sounded a note of warning 
tonight in a speech at Edinburgh. 


Assails Withdrawal Hint 


Citing apparently inspired press 
lent suggesting that the Allies 
hdraw from Southern and Cen- 
Norway, Sir Archibald declared 

a withdrawal be justi- 
fied only if in the opinion of naval, 
ary and air force commanders 
situation there was beyond re- 
pair. In that case, he said, “‘it 
would be criminal to waste valua- 
ble lives in a hopeless effort to re- 
trieve it.’ 

If that was the case, he con- 
tinued, searching questions would 
have to be asked and Parliament | 
must ‘‘act objectively, 
and resolutely if it app ears the gov- 

ernment has blundered.’ 

He held the country was entitled 
to know whether the troops sent to 
undertake that hazardous enter- 
prise were well-trained regulars, 
properly officered and equipped.

for War, replying to questions on 
this score in the House of Commons

this afternoon gave assurances that | 


units sent to Norway were “‘in

scales of war equipment.’ § Sir 
Archibald demanded vigorous and 
determined British action in Norway 
and criticized ‘‘the feebleness of our 
political direction.’’ He expressed 
the hope that ‘‘it is not yet too late 
for craven and irresolute counsels 
to be suppressed 

At the same time the Labor party’s 
national executive issued its an- 
nual report, declaring that although 
there was an electoral truce with 


the government, there was no po-

Cites “‘False Prophets ”’ 


Without naming Mr. Chamberlain, 

the Liberal leader in his Edinburgh 

| speech referred to 
Prime Minister's utterances. 

“Tam amazed,”’ he declared, “at 
the false prophets telling us Hitler 
has ‘missed the bus’; that we have 
‘turned the corner’ and are now 
‘ten times more confident than six 
months ago.’ That reminds me of 
the prophesy that 
‘peace in our time.’’ 

Sir Archibald appealed 
trals, particularly Belgium, to ‘“‘face 
the facts.’’ 

By postponing even preparatory 
staff conversations until 
they become victims of German ag- 
gression,’’ he said, ‘‘these neutrals 
make it impossible for Britain to 
save them from invasion.”’ 

Thus it was that reports of Ger- 
man successes today in the strate- 
gically important Dombaas and 
Stoerner regions of Norway as- 
sumed significance out of propor- 
tion to their military importance in 
the large strategic picture of this 
war. The success of Herr 
gamble in Southern Norway, it 
recognized here, may win him an 
ally in the Mediterranean.

Britain's life line. They are

merce and economy. They are 
greater importance strategically 
and from the viewpoint of prestige. 

If the Mediterranean is closed 
British merchant shipping, a con- 
siderable additional strain will be 
placed on Britain’s economy. The 
need for more merchant tonnage, a 
need already aggravated by the 
war, will be immediately felt. But 
the most pressing problem will be 
the adequate supply of the Allies’ 
Near Eastern Armies in Egypt, 
Palestine and Syria. That task in 
the World War was considerably 
complicated, not by complete sever 
ance of the trade routes through 
the inland sea but merely by the 
harassing action of a few German 
submarines. 

Normally about sixteen 
merchantmen of more than 10,000 
tons and 122 merchantmen of 3,000 
to 10,000 tons are in the Mediter- 
ranean on any one day and forty-

Only about 10 per cent 
food is normally carried 
through the Mediterranean. Much 
of the oil now going to Britain and 
France, however, comes from the 
Near East. It is estimated about 
250,000 barrels of oil from this 
source move daily through the 
Mediterranean, in addition to other 
shipments from the Netherlands 
Indies. Perhaps three times as 
many tankers as those now in use 
would be required to move this oil 
around Africa instead of through

how the first or Norwegian part of 
Herr Hitler's campaign worked out

The significance of the order to 
British merchant ships to keep out

being cannot, therefore, be over- 
looked, although responsible quar- 
ters here are still skeptical about

Order Issued Two Days Ago 


It was understood that the order 
to ships went out from here two 
days ago, although the first inkling 
of it leaked out this morning It 
was not confirmed until tonight, 
when an authorized statement said: 

“It is learned in authoritative cir- 
cles that pronouncements by Ital 
ians in responsible positions and 
the attitude of the Italian press 
have been recently of such a char 
acter as to make it necessary for 
His Majesty’s Government to take 
certain precautions as regards Brit- 
ish shipping which would normally 


| pass through the Mediterranean. 


“They do not intend, however, 
to continue these precautions any 
longer than is necessary and they 
| hope that circumstances will permit 
cancellation in the near fu- 
ture.’ 

This came as something of a sur- 
prise, for over the week-end the 
Italian Ambassador, Giuseppe Bas- 
talked with Viscount Hali- 


and it was reported that progress 
had been made toward better eco- 
nomic relations between Italy and 
Britain. That, it was emphasized, 
was purely on the economic side, 


| which is but one facet of the many- 


sided Italian problem, and it was 
not by any means conclusive. 

At the same time the response of 
Russia to the British response to 
Moscow's feeler about reopening 
trade negotiations leaves little room 
for hope of improvement even of 
economic relations between the 
Soviet Union and Britain

Italy Plans No Immediate Step 


Shipping in New York were 
not greatly concerned § yesterday 
with the British decision to reroute 
Mediterranean shipping around the 
Cape of Good Hope. Similar altera 
tions in schedules were effected 
during the Spanish Civil War, when 
many vessels in the New York 
trade sailed around Africa rather 
than risk passage through Mediter- 
ranean waters, 

Reports that the Italian liner Rex 
had sailed from Genoa on time yes 
terday indicated further that Italy 
planned no early step to enter the 
war 

The two leading American vessels 
in the the Manhattan and 
Washington, will not be affected, 
officials of the United States Lines 
announced, The Manhattan arrived 
yesterday at Genoa and the Wash 
ington is in port here. 

Numerous other freighters and 
liners of American registry are in 
Mediterranean waters. The Ameri

Attack Upon France 


Meanwhile, the “‘spiritual mobili- 
zation” of the Italian people against 
the Allies in full swing, with 
every newspaper in the country 
launching an attack against 
France. 

The occasion today was supplied 
by of Italy's struggle to 
achieve national unity in the nine- 
teenth century. On April 30, 1849, 
French troops sent by Louis Napo- 
leon Italy, in support of the 
Pope, clashed at the gates of Rome 
with the Italians led by Giuseppe 
Garibaldi, and were routed 

This episode, which has 
vived for the first time today in 
Fascist Italy as a means of antl- 
French propaganda, is used by the 
commentators to point out to the 
Italians that France has always 
sought to prevent Italy’s ascension, 
and has been her enemy all along 
The purpose of this campaign is 
clear It aims at convincing the 
Italians that, far from being grate- 
ful to foreign powers, they must 
think only of their own interests, 
regardless of whether they conflict 
| with those of nations that the 
| takenly consider friendly to them 

This campaign, it may be added, 
has been intensified since April 21, 
when Premier Mussolini made a 
speech to the hierarchs of the cor- 
porations The speech, though 
never printed, is by now a matter 
of public knowledge 
According to many sources, Pre- 
mier Mussolini told his listeners 
that not one Italian ship had 
escaped the Allied control, and 
after enumerating several instances 
of Allied seizures of Itatian goods, 
he is supposed to have stressed 
that this situatié “places us be- 
fore a hard reality that must de 
prive the Italian people of all illu- 
sions—we are really prisoners be- 
tween Gibraltar and Suez.”’ 

Signor Mussolini is understood to 
have condemned those Italians who 
“without political acumen and 
of a continental hegemony

ed to pointed out that ‘‘in 
order to be independent a people 
must have direct access to the 
oceans; it is idependent if 
it has an indirect is not

4-Point Reported 


ROME, April 30 (UP)—Pope Pius 
XII wax reported in high Vatican 
quarters tonight to be striving to 
avert an explosion in Italo-British 
relations and to bring about a 
reconciliation on the basis of a 
four-point proposal made by Pre- 
mier Benito Mussolini 

According to these high ecclesias 
tical the first direct 
sult of the Pontiff'sa intervention 
in the situation was a long con 
versation in London last Friday be- 
tween the British Foreign Secre- 
tary and the Italian Ambassador 

The Italian Government, after 
being sounded out by the Holy See, 
was said to have indicated a willing 
ness to reconcile its differences 
with Britain provided it could be 
done on the basis of four special 
points that Signor Mussolini re 
garded as fundamental in his policy: 
1. Italy’s position in the Mediter- 

ranean must be revised: 

2. British assurances that Italian 
interests in the Balkans will not 
be harmed by British economic 
pressure in that region; 
Recognition Britain that the

$1,000,000 for Capture of Hitler Alive 


Continued From Page One ” . — - 


not that I doubted the possibility of 
success of the plan-—nor do I doubt 
it now—but because I doubted that 
it would strike the imagination of 
|} the world in the manner that it) 
should. | 

“But I felt that there was some 
power in the idea, especially so be- 
cause it is not in any sense an offer 
of reward for an assassination, and 
so I have come to believe that it 
will indeed catch peoples’ imagina-| 
tion.”’ 

Recalls Effort to Catch Kaiser 


Recalling that after the close of 
|the World War a group of Ameri- 
|cans actually did make an attempt 
|to capture the former Kaiser in 


| Holland, Mr. Church remarked that

grandiose adventure. 

“I believe in my heart,’”’ Mr. 
Church continued, ‘‘that Mr. Hitler 
should be held as the common 
enemy of mankind and brought to 
justice accordingly. Unthinking 
people may say that this war is a’ 
between the haves and the 
that it has arisen from 
economic causes; but that is a con-| 
which will not bear exami-| 
nation by any one who has read 
Mr. Hitler's book, as TI have. 

“He has in his brain the same 
criminal motive which has guided 
the destroyers of civilization of 
other times: he is consumed with 
the desire of conquering the world 
for the mere pleasure of conquering 
the world

Mr. Church said that, although in : Oup wen ante to ouP EY 
the letter in which the reward of 
fer was set forth he had stipulated 
trial by the “League of Nations, he 
did not think it would be wise for 
any one to attempt to deliver the 
German Chancellor to the League 
seat at Geneva. All Switzerland, he 
was sure, would be overrun by the 
German Army 

“The proper goal,” he continued 

would be England. But the ques- 
tion of trial would be too big for 
Great Britain or for any other one 
intry. A court of all the civilized 
nations of the world should try such

Preponderance in Planes Held 
to Be Chief Factor in ‘Second 
Round’ in Norway 


ALLIED POSITION CRITICAL 


Aandalsnes Base Is Believed 
to Be in Peril and Namsos 
Area Not Too Secure 


By HANSON W. BALDWIN 
Air power has won the second 
round in Norway. 
The juncture of German forces op- 


erating from Trondheim and Oslo, 
reported yesterday, was primarily 


|; due to German air superiority over 


Norway. That superiority could not 
prevent Allied sea power from cov- 
ering the landings of Allied troops 
in Southern and Central Norway; 
thus sea power won the first round 
against air power 

But Ailied troops found difficulty 
in getting ashore; the smal! and in 
adequate ports at which they landed 
were repeatedly bombed; supply 
bases and ammunition dumps were 
endangered; the gruelling job of 
getting heavy equipment ashore in 
small boats was complicated; sup- 
ply lines, both at seat and on land, 


|} were endangered 


| 
| 


| harried 


| 


Once ashore the Allied troops were 
continuously by German 
planes, and they faced, on the 
ground, yerman forces probably 
considerably superior to their own, 
troops whose own land communica 
tion lines were not threatened by air 
power, whose sea lines of communi 
cation were harried, but not cut, by 
British sea power The Germans,

of the Allied forces, which have 
been using Molde and Aandalsnes 
as bases, may well become critical 
and it may be necessary to with 
draw these forces 

Further north, at Namsos, the Al 
lied forces appear to be more solidly 
established and in less danger of 
isolation, although even there their 
situation cannot be termed comfort- 
able until their base of operations

WARNS OF ‘ANARCHY’ Brings Family Reunion 


It Will Prevail if Hitler Is 
Victor, Archdake Says 


Archduke Otto, pretender to the 
Austro-Hungarian throne of the 
Hapsburgs, left yesterday for Paris 
via Lisbon aboard the Atlaantic 
Clipper from La Guardia Field, pre- 
dicting that anarchy wiil reign in 
Europe in Hitler’s Germany should 
win the war. 

“Such an anarchy,”’ he said in a 
prepared handed to the 
press, ‘‘would effect 
the economic security of all nations, 
of Western 


‘‘unbelievably”’ 


statement 
undoubtedly 
including those the 
Hemisphere 

He added, however, that the Nazi 
“must and will fall,”’ as 
based “hatred, godlessness and 
serfdom,’ and he expressed his 
own belief that the absorption into 
the Reich of such non-German peo- 
ples as Poles, Czechs, Danes and 
now Norwegians might lead to a 
revolution from within. 

Archduke Otto signed the Clipper’s 
passenger list under the title ‘‘Otto 
de Bar’’ and gave his nationality 
as Hungarian and his occupation 
as ‘“‘none.”’ He was accompanied 
by his aide, Count Francis von 
Trauttmansdorff. Among the eight- 
een passengers were Mlle. Eve 
Curie, Eugene Gentil, a member of 
the French Purchasing Commission 
to the United States, and Charles 
Rist, economic adviser to. the 
French Ministry of Blockade.

Britain withdraws control of Swiss 
exports and receives in return a 
guarantee that Swiss imports will 
be used for domestic consumption, 
for demands above ordinary result 
ing from mobilization and for re 
exportation in the form of finished 
goods 

Germany, it is remarked here, did 
not place any such limitations on 
her agreements with Switzerland 

“It remains to be seen,’* it is 
stated, ‘‘whether Switzerland has 
thereby undertaken any obligations 
conflicting with her German agree- 
ment. The fundamental standpoint 
of the Reich, it is remembered, is 
that any obligation of a neutral to- 
ward an enemy State must be re- 
garded as unneutral if it violates 
normal trade relations.”’

workers of the world 
the European war threatens 
spread to the Balkans, the Near 
East and the Pacific. 

The lengthy appeal, which occu- 
| pled nearly four on the 
| front page of the Communist party 
| 
| newspaper Pravda, urged workers 
| of all countries to unite under the 
of 
| capitalism and against war. 
by the Comintern Central Execu- 
tive Committee, it said that the end 
|of war was not in sight. It pointed 
j}out that Scandinavia was already 
}a theatre of war, and that Belgium 
and the Netherlands were fright- 
ened, then added 

‘‘In the Near East another war 
arena has been prepared The 
| struggle of the imperialist countries 
| for the Balkans and for the Medi

capitalistic nations into the war. 

‘Italy, who has fortified her po- 
sition in Spain and the Balkans,

added yesterday to the growing list 
of attractions exp@cted to make t 
renewal of the expggition a ‘'must 
on the schedule of mUltons of Amer 
icans 

With the committee organized by 
Mayor La Guardia to map the city 
wide celebration for the Q@pening on 
May 11 due to meet at_City Hall 
this afternoon, it becaMle known 
that nearly $6,000,000. had been 
spent by tpe Fair administration 
and by 500” exhibitors and conces 
sionnaires in a broad-fronted drive 
to refurbish and renovate the 
| World of Tomorrow 

Fair officials, without 
formal breakdown of that 
dicated privately that pr 
$3,500,000 had been put by th® Fair 
into the multitudinous pajpting, 
paving, planting and gener me 
chanical improvement projects@The 
balance was believed to have been 
the sum spent on installation, re 
arrangement and general toaning-uf 
by the exhibitors 

Yegterday, the first 
of the opening of the F 
“ra alls of the ceremonies a week 

from Saturday remained incot™- 
plete. The impression arose, how- 
ever, that the crowded pomp of the 
| kind held by many to have ‘‘scared

itors in 1939’ s@two ‘‘biggest days’

Special to Tak New Yorn Times 
| WASHINGTON, April 30—Presi- 
|\dent Roosevelt came to the defense 
jtoday of his proposal, now under 
ifire in Congress, transfer the 
Civil Aeronautics Authority to the 
Commerce Department and abolish 
the Air Safety Board. The changes 
|} would be made under his pending 
third and fourth reorganization or- 
ders. 
| The President was obviously an- 
|gered at the failure of a single 
member of Congress to raise a voice 
jin of the civil aviation 
changes, while The Congressional 
Record for two weeks has published 
jattack after attack 
| When, at his press conference, he 
| was asked if he intended to rescind 


to 


defense 


\ the orders and issue others omitting 


| the CAA changes, as some members 
|of Congress hoped he would do, Mr. 


| Roosevelt replied indignantly in the 
negative and told the newspaper 
; men that a statement 
| ject would be ready for them as 
| they left. 

TEXT OF THE STATEMENT 


The statement read as follows: 

“Since the transmittal of Reor- 
ganization Plans Numbers III and 
IV, a flood of misinformation has 
lenguifed those sections dealing 
with the Civil Aeronautics Author- 
ity. Much of this has fallen of its 
}own absurdity and needs no com- 
This morning, however, we 
saw a group of well-intentioned 


O¢

fo yout order : ciate to © e0-called ‘lobby to eave 


“The implication that we are not 
interested in saving lives, which is 
| certainly contradicted by the record 
|of our progress in civil aviation 
| during recent years, compels me to 
| restate in simple terms the basic 
|features of the Reorganization 


|Plans affecting the Civil Aero- 
|nautics Authority. 

| “YT might say here that everybody 
|is for the abstract idea of reorgan- 
| ization in the interest of increased 
|} efficiency and economy. However, 
| there is a rather discouraging col- 
lapse of enthusiasm when concrete 
proposals are made. In selfish pro- 
tection of their own special inter- 
ests we always find particular 
groups who hitherto favored reor- 
ganization arising in protest. 

“As it now stands, there are 
|three  agencies—the Civil Aero- 
| nautics five-member authority, the 
Administrator and the Air Safety 
Board—all autonomous groups, none 
| of them represented at the Cabinet 
| table 

‘The inherent problems confront- 

ing them were intensified by fric- 
| tion, particularly within 
Safety Board. For five months the 
|} administrative management divi 
sion of the Budget Bureau made a 
study at my request of the opera- 
| tion of the Authority. It became 
| obvious that a change was impera- 
tive if we were to continue to move 
forward in cfvil aviation. Here, in 
simple summary, is the proposal 

“1. Despite handicaps, the Fed- 

eral program for civil aeronautics 
has now achieved a stature and im 
portance which justify bringing this 
program more closely into the Fed 
eral family. The proposal will place 
it within the framework of the 
| Department of Commerce, where It 
will have a closer relationship with 
the important reporting services of 
| the Weather Bureau and the essen- 
tial air navigation chart service of 
| the Coast and Geodetic Survey 
More than that, it will provide rep- 
resentation at the Cabinet table for 
|} @ program of basic significance to 
our national transportation and our 
national defense. Present world 
conditions make the merit of this 
phase of the proposal obvious. 

“2. The present five-member Au 

thority, which has received such 
widespread praise, remains as 
an independent Civil Aeronautics 
Board performing the basic regu 
| latory functions. It will continue 
| to appoint and control its own per 
| sonnel and submit its own budget. 


To End “Blind Spot’? One Aim 


‘3. Certain of the Authority's 
functions are transferred to the Ad 
| ministrator to eliminate a blind spot 

created by the failure of the Civil 
| Aeronautics Act of 1938 to carry 
out the intention of Congress to dis 
tinguish clearly between the func 
tions of the Administrator and the 
Authority. 
“4. The function of investigating 
| accidents is transferred to the Civil 
Aeronautics Board, which, unlike 
| the present Air Safety Board, will 
|not be helpless to take positive 
| steps toward preventing the recur- 
rence of accidents. Unlike the Air 
Safety Board, the Civil Aeronautics 
Board will have the power to pre 
scribe air safety rules, regulations 
and standards, and to suspend or 
revoke certificates after hearing 
Not only does this continue the 
present independence of accident in 
vestigation, but it also makes possi 
ble prompt translation of findings 
into corrective action. 

‘5. Not only are we advancing the 
cause of air safety by these 
| changes, but we will also realize ap- 
|preciable savings. Several highly 
paid positions on the Air Safety 
Board will be eliminated and other 
economies made possible.”’ 

The President’s reference to a 
“lobby to save lives’’ apparently 
meant a statement issued yesterday 
| by eleven veteran airline pilots who 
| opposed his reorganization plan and 
| called themselves ‘‘the Lobby to 
Save Lives.”’ 

The reference to the friction be 
| tween the Air Safety Board and the 
other two organizations within the 
CAA, which was prime reason 
for the proposed reorganization, 
| brought that question into the open 
Things reached such a pass, ac- 
| cording to Administration critics of 
| the present seffup, that two mem- 
| bers of the board would report one 
|}cause for an accident, while the 
third would submit a dissenting 
opinion assigning some other cause.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 


DISCUSSES NEW DEAL 
W. Gibson Carey Jr., president 
of the United States Chamber of 


Commerce, at yesterday’s meeting 
in Washington, Times Wide World 


the Capitol was in a 
the fu 
orders, 


Meantime, 
state of uncertainty about 
ture of the reorganization 
due largely to the fact that Ad 
ministration leaders there have 
heen unable to make up their minds 
how to proceed. On April 11 Sena 

McCarran introduced a resolu- 
tion to reject both orders 

The MeCarran resolution was re- 
ferred to the Senate Committee on 
Government Organization, of which 
Senator Byrnes is chairman. The 
committee has held no meeting or 
made no plans, ostensibly because 
Mr. McCarran was called out of 
town and an agreement had been 
reached not to do anything until 
he returned 

Senator McCarran is due to re- 
turn to the capital tomorrow morn- 
ing, but Senator Byrnes has left 
Washington for several days. Un- 
der the Reorganization act, any 
Senator is eligible to move to dis- 
charge the committee from further 
consideration of the resolution, ten 
days after its introduction, and 
bring the issue to the floor. A 
reorganization order goes into ef 
fect sixty days after promulgation, 
unless Congress disapproves 

On the House side the Committee 
on Government Organization is 
headed by Representative Cochran 
of Missouri, who has been delaying 
action on the rejection resolution 
introduced by Representative Lea 
of California, in the hope the Senate 
would act one way or the other. 

Administration supporters on the 
House side backed up the first two 
reorganization orders issued by the 
President and they feel it is the 
Senate's turn this time. 

Representative Cochran said to 
day, however, that he will summon 
his committee of nine members to 
meet by the end of the week, if the 
Senate does not act, and will try to 
obtain an adverse report on the Lea 
resolution. If the committee does 
not report by Monday, which will 
be ten days after the Lea resolution 
was introduced, Mr. Cochran is con- 
vinced some House member will 
move to discharge the committee. 

Foes of the orders say they have 
polled the committee and find that 
only three members positively favor 
an adverse report, four are opposed 
and two are in doubt. Mr. Cochran 
declined to express any opinion on 
the members’ attitude. 


Denounces Critica of Order 
By The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON, April 30—Presi- 
dent Roosevelt, defending his pro 
posal for transferring the civil 
aeronautic program to the Com- 
merce Department, asserted today 
that its critics had loosed a ‘‘flood 
of misinformation’’ based on igno- 
rance, gullibility or politics 
After telling reporters at his press 
conference that much of the criti 
cism was absurd, he added that, 
luckily, the people had caught on. 
On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, there 
were signs that opposition to the

was abolished in 1933. 

He recommended, first, that ‘‘the 
next President’’ enlarge the staff 
and strengthen the authority of the 
Director of the Budget; second, 
that he make it a qualification of 
every Cabinet officer that he pledge 
himself to support a plan for reduc- 


ing governmental expenditures and 
balancing the budget; third, that 
the President call a budget confer- 
ence of his departmental and bu- 
reau heads the first month of his 
first term and announce a budget 
policy, and, fourth, that ‘‘the next 
President’’ begin an immediate at 
tack on high-rate governmental 
spending and call in the aid of

“The budget can best be balanced 
in the way which any private o1 
ganization, with its business in the 
demoralized condition of our pres- 
ent government business, would 
take as a matter of course,” he 
said. ‘‘Mistake not, the budget of 
the United States can be balanced.”’ 

The administration’s budgetary 
policies were under fire by Chamber 
speakers throughout the day, in a 
general session in the morning, at 
the luncheon forum and at the din 
ner 

At the morning session, Governor 
Raymond E. Baldwin of Connecti- 
cut asserted that the fiscal situa 
tion in the government was a 
menace to our national defense 

‘We are a country already finan- 
cially crippled in case of a national 
emergency,” Governor Baldwin 
said. ‘‘Not seriously so, as yet, but 
can we afford, in the troubled state 
of world affairs today, to go on 
allowing ourselves to become 
weaker and weaker, like a man 
having his blood slowly drained 
away?” 

The Federal debt, with its ‘‘ap- 
palling level of $43,000,000,000,"’ 
was placed at the head of a list of 
eight factors which W. Gibson 
Carney Jr., president of the cham- 
ber, cited in his annual address as 
evidence of a decade of ‘‘misman- 
agement’’ of the nation’s resources. 

Mr. Carey listed a reduction of 
Federal expenditures, a_ balanced 
budget and a reduction of the 
national debt as ‘‘fundamental 
changes most needed’’ to readjust 
the economy of the countr.

TAFT GROUP DISPUTES 
CLAIMS FOR DEWEY 


Statement Says Most Delegates 
From Soath Will Be for Senator | 


Special te THe New Yorx Times 

WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
headquarters of Senator Robert A. | 
Taft issued a statement today dis-| 
puting claims put out on behalf of 
Thomas E. Dewey as to the number 
of delegates pledged to Mr. Dewey. | 

The Taft forces asserted that Mr. 
Dewey would not have the twenty- | 
three delegates from North Caro-| 


lina, as had been claimed, but that | 
eighteen of them would be for the | 
Ohio Senator. It also was asserted | 
that all of the lowa delegates would 
Mr. Taft Mr 

Dewey, and that than 
of to be 
chosen in California would be won 
by New Yorker Statements 
that twenty Missouri delegates 
would be for Mr. Dewey were called 

absurd. 

“With respect to the South, where | 
the claim is made that Mr. Dewey | 
will have eighty-three delegates, it | 
is true that strenuous efforts have | 
been made by Dewey managers to | 
delegates,”’ the statement 
said, ‘‘but it is equally true that the 
natural and normal sentiment of | 
the Southern States, without a sin- 
gle exception, is for Senator Taft, 
and that it is entirely possible that 
Mr. Gannett will have more dele- 
gates from the South than Mr. | 
Dewey . 

“Senator ‘Taft will be the real 
choice fo1 resident of a majority 
of the delegates and will be nomi- 
nated when these delegates feel free 
to exercise their own judgment. 
Senator Taft will have more votes 
on the first ballot than any other 
candidate and is the second choice 
of more delegates than any other 
candidate.”

chicken-tender BREADED VEAL CUTLETS at Childs: The 
tang of a rich, rosy tomato purée, the delicate hint of little, 
young onions, the good flavor of crisp celery, the savour of 
cloves and thyme. And there’s a merger that’s hard to describe 
... but your tongue will tell at the very first taste. The cutlet 
itself is breaded and fried till a golden crust seals the flavor 
in... that delicate flavor of young milk-fed veal. And along 
with this very succulent dish comes a plump white potato, 
dipped in butter and sprinkled with parsley, and a helping of 
tender young peas and poppyseed rolls and date or walnut 
muffins, baked in our own ovens this morning. That's the 
headliner luncheon at Childs today and it’s yours for 4()¢

se has a better chance of Mr. Roosevelt is renominated, the

will go Republican again 

Spokesmen for Mr. Replogle and 
C. H. McNulty, Melbourne banker 
who is chairman of the Republican 
State Executive Committee, express 
indifference to the rival slate of 
delegates elected by the Orlarido 
convention. Contrary to charges 
made at Orlando, the Replogle 
forces say that election of their 
delegates by the State Executive 
Committee on March 18 was strictly 
in accord with Florida law, and 
that the Orlando delegates will 
have no standing at Philadelphia. 
They assert that Mr. Replogle act- 
ed upon legal advice, and that his 
delegates will be seated by the Na- 
tional Convention's credentials com- 
mittee without any question. 

The Replogle forces confirm Or- 
lando reports that they refused to 
treat with the Taft and Gannett 
leaders who proposed a compromise 
before March 18 under which they 
later would have been allowed to 
pick some of the delegates on the 
organization slate. According to 
Replogle spokesmen, the organiza- 
tion was so strong that it had no 
reason to make any compromise. 

In reply to charges that Mr. Rep- 
logle used ‘‘a steamroller’’ to flat- 
ten out the opposition at the 
meeting six weeks ago, it was said

As to opposition charges that ex- 
cessive amounts of money were 
spent by Mr. Replogle to control 
the Florida delegation, it was said 
on his behalf that a comparatively 
small amount had been spent and 
that all of it had been used legally.

DEWEY OVER ILLNESS, 
BUT ‘TAKES IT EASY’ 


Stays in Room at Colorado 
Springs—May Try Golf Today 


Special to THe New York Times 

COLORADO SPRINGS, Col., 
April 30—-Thomas E. Dewey had 
completely recovered today from an 
ipset stomach, but, acting under 
doctor's orders, ‘‘took it easy’’ and 
yemained in his hotel room. 

The Republican Presidential can- 
didate felt so much better that he 
asked Dr. John A. Sevier, the house 
physician who has been treating 
him, if he might get up and play 
a round of golf. Dr. Sevier advised 
against it, telling Mr. Dewey he 
might better ‘‘just loaf around”’ to- 
day. 

Acquiescing in the doctor’s orders, 
Mr. Dewey spent the day in bed, 
reading newspapers and magazines 
and chatting with members of his 
party. He also played several 
games of chess with John Altrich- 
ter, maitre d’hotel 

If the weather is fair, Mr. Dewey 
probably will leave his bed tomor- 
row and shoot a little golf in the 
afternoon. He will continue his 
rest here until Thursday night, 
when he will resume the second 
half of his transcontinental cam- 
paign tour for delegates and head 
back East 

Mr. Dewey will speak in Wichita 
on Friday evening and in Marshall- 
town, ‘lowa, on Saturday. He ex- 
pects to return to New York early 
Monday morning. Originally the 
Dewey party was scheduled to re- 
turn home Thursday, but Mr. 
Dewey's indisposition brought a 
four-day delay in the tour. 


STELLE DROPS FIGHT 


Ceases to Press Claim to Act as 
Governor—Horner Inquiry Voted 


SPRINGFIELD, Ill., April 30 (> 

An investigation of the Horner 
administration’s spending was vot- 
ed unanimously today by the House 
during a day which saw Lieutenant 
Governor John Stelle surrender his 
disputed claim to the title of Acting 
Governor 

Mr. Stelle took his customary 
place as presiding officer of the 
Senate when the special session of 
the General Assembly opened, thus 
dropping automatically his claim of 
having taken over the duties of the 
ailing Governor Henry Horner. 

The House resolution does not re- 
quire Senate approval, since it 
called for only an _ investigating 
committee of seven House mem- 
bers 

In taking the Lieutenant Gover- 
nor’s chair again, Mr. Stelle said 
that he did so ‘‘to expedite passage 
old age pension increase,”’ 
but would not discuss future plans.

movement was effected by the 
Garner and Roosevelt forces today, 
assuring harmony in the Texas 
Democratic convention 

This development, which Mr. Gar- 
ner’s followers said meant the com- 
plete collapse of the Garner move 
ment for President, reducing him 
to the favorite-son category, came 
as Democratic leaders from Iowa 
called at the White House and 
urged the President run for a 
third term 

The harmony deal for Texas was 
made by the Roosevelt and Garner 
eaders to prevent a struggle in the 
convention which, if persisted in by 
the Roosevelt wing, would have 
caused a bitter battle and divided 
the delegates between the Presi- 
dent and Vice President 

Cessation of the ‘‘stop Roosevelt’ 
movement, forecast since the Wis- 
consin and Illinois primaries, was 
construed even by anti-New Deal 
Senate leaders as giving the Presi 
dent unquestioned domination 
the national convention, making 
him powerful enough to have him- 
self renominated or to pick his suc- 
if he selects one at all ac- 
ceptable to the conservatives.

But this does not interest the group that wants 


to set up socialized medicine as part of the col-

the U. S. Congress and State Assemblies to put the 
relations between doctors and patients under 
political control.

WALSH-HEALEY WAGES 


Overruling the District of Columbia 
Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court 
has dismissed the case of a group of 
seven “Little Steel” who 
contended that the Department of La- 
bor had exceeded its authority under 
the Walsh-Healey defining a 
“locality,” for example, so broadly that 
it covered fourteen States. The Su- 
preme Court passed over the question 
of whether the Secretary of Labor had

exceeded her authority un law, 


and simply declared that the steel com- 
panies had not proved injury to a par- 
ticular right of their own and therefore 
had no standing in court. This raises 


the practical question of how, if the 


Secretary of Labor actually exceeds her 


legal authority under the Walsh-Healey 
act, she can be called to account. The 
need for some such control as that em- 
bodied in the Walter-Logan bill, which 
the House recently passed by a vote of 
nearly three to one, seems evident, 
Apart from the legal 
volved, the Walsh-Healey act as it has 
been actually applied is economically 
indefensible. Its main provision com-

minimum wage,” as determined by the

practice appears to have been to divide 
the workers into various brackets ac- 
cording to they 
take the wages paid to approximately 
the lowest fourth the workers and

prevailing minimum, matter how 
high it was in the first place.

Advice from a doctor on how to live

his orders are palatable we will sub-

deserves attention because he has hon-

Colonel Tweed resigned as chief

1931 after a quarrel with the elec- 
tion committee. He engaged in 
political work at an early age. Dur- 
ing the four years before the World 
War he was Liberal agent for the 
Eccles Division, a post he quit to 
become an army officer. Invalided 
in war service, he returned home to 
become secretary of the Manchester

1927-31, and secretary, Liberal Or- 
ganization Committee, 1930-31. He 
was also chairman of the 
Benevolent Fund. 

As a 
pabilities were quickly recognized 
and he moved upward accordingly. 
At the age of 24 he was commis- 
sioned in the Lancashire Fusileers. 
Only two years later he was com- 
manding a battalion. He was pro- 
moted to major in February, 1916, 
the year he won the military cross 
for gallant conduct at Theipval. By 
September, 1916, he was second in 
command of the regiment and less

permitted to listen to their favorite | 
daytime adventure skits on the! 
radio only after they have eaten | 
bowlfuls of the nourishing break-| 

foods advertised by the spon-| 
sors of the skits | 

This brief revelation about the! 
domestic affairs of the city’s chief | 
was given yesterday by} 
Mayor La Guardia in a talk to 200 
Brooklyn housewives attending a 
cooking class conducted twice week- 
ly by the Department of Markets 
at the building of Flatlands Post, 
American Legion, 2295 Nostrand 
Avenue, Brooklyn. 

Standing behind the instructor’s| 
table, which was laden with cook-| 
ing utensils and various cooking in-| 
gredients, the Mayor covered a 
wide range of cookery information, 
from the economic problems in-| 
| volved in the distribution of car- 
loads of foodstuffs throughout the} 
city to suggestions about how to 
arrange the family menus so as to 
get the most for as little money as 
possible. : 

“Don’t get the idea we think the 
New York housewife doesn’t know 
how to cook,’’ the Mayor said. ‘‘She 
does, and she knows what is best 
for her family. But in promoting 
these cooking classes we have two 
main objects, first to eliminate 
waste and second to “reduce the 
family budget.”’ 

The housewife’s budget problem, 
the Mayor admitted, is knottier | 
even than that faced by either the 
Governor with the State budget or| 
the Mayor with the $600,000,000 city 
budget 

According to Mr. LaGuardia, the 
food wasted in New York each day 
feed a good-size city. New 
York's waste, he said, was far 
greater than that of London, Paris 
Berlin.

KITCHEN INSPECTION DUTY 


Dishes of Girl Scouts 
To Liking of First Lady 


By The Associated Press. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—Mrs. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt praised 
the cooking at a Girl Scout Iunch- 
eon today. She took a second 
helping of scalloped chicken, 
praised the sponge oake, and 
said: 

“Every one—boys as well as girls 
—should learn how to cook.”’ 

Frances Dowden, 15, baked the 
cake that prompted Mrs. Roose 
velt to exclaim: 

“This is delicious sponge cake. 
I know how hard they are to bake 
for I used to make them when I 
was young.” 

Mrs. sroke a prece- 
dent and invited a man to her 
press conference. The guest, Dr. 
Will W. Alexander, the Farm Se- 
curity administrator, told the 
women reporters that 800,000 
loans aggregating $369,000,000 
had been made up to Jan. 31 to 
help migratory workers such as 
those portrayed in ‘‘The Grapes 
of Wrath.”’ 


Roosevelt 6b 


will provide enough excess heat to 
cook the pie.”’ 

Amid audible whispered protests 
from the audience, the Mayor add- 
ed: “‘When you boil water, get a 
head start by drawing the water 
from your hot-water tap. 

“For the sake of your children 
you must avoid monotony in cook- 
ing. From the ages of 3 or 4 to 11 
or 12 the problem of their diet is a 
serious one. It’s easy to serve their 
food attractively, and will make a 
difference in doctors’ bills later on. 

“The city watches the food mar- 
kets and if there is a surplus of 
something we go after it and sell it 
to you at the lowest possible cost. 
After all, ‘surpluses’ usually mean 
simply bad planning and distribu- 
tion. We read of wheat surpluses, 
but if every child in America had 
a& wholesome sandwich for lunch 
every day, there would be no wheat 
surplus. Similarly, there would be 
no milk surplus if every child in the 
United States had all the milk he 
should drink.”’

BRITAIN BOYCOTTS 


GONE WITH WIND’ 


700 Theatres Refuse to Show 
Motion Picture Because of 
High Rental Demands 


Special Cable to Tue New Yorxk Times. 

LONDON, April 30—More than 
700 British theatres boycotted “Gone 
| With the Wind”’ today as Commons 
| took time out to discuss why people 
of this country should be forced to 
|} pay a minimum of 70 cents in the 
jafternoon and 90 cents at night to 
| see that old gunrunner, Rhett But- 
ler. 


| It is not that 


the British have 
anything against Rhett (though 
they think Scarlett is ‘‘a bit of a 
hussy’’). It is simply that they seem 
to feel his love comes pretty high at 
90 cents, and the gentlemen as- 
sembled in sober session in West- 
minster this afternoon went to work 
to see what could be done about 
whittling down the price a little. 

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distribu- 
| tors of the film, are said to be ask- 
jing 70 per cent of theatre takings, 
linsisting on these minimum prices. 
|A few days ago the Cinematograph 
Exhibitors Association urged all 
British exhibitors not to show the 
movie on these terms and today the 
Jaumont-British Corporation and 
the large Odoen Circuit announced 
they had no intention of showing 
the picture at their 700 theatres un- 
less the rental was reduced, 

Meanwhile, Major Sir Jocelyn Lu- 
cas rose in Commons and asked 
why, in view of the nation’s desire 
to conserve its dollar exchange, 
rental films should not be limited. 
Before Major Lloyd George had 
time to answer for the Board of 
Trade, Neil MacLean, opposition 
Laborite, asked the government to 
investigate ‘‘the manner in which 
American film companies are abus- 
ing their powers.”’ | 

Lloyd George replied he under-! 
stood the rental of 70 per cent is | 
“considerably higher than usual, 
but added it is not higher than the 
fee charged United States exhibitors 
for the same film. 

Lloyd George pointed out to the 
House that the Cinematograph 
Films Act doee not give the presi- 
dent of the Board of Trade power 
to regulate film rentals, but this 
did not satisfy Scotsman MacLean, 
who demanded to know if some 
'thing could not be done to prevent 
Americans from charging ‘‘exhor- 
bitant prices’’ and predicted that 
when the war finishes movie the- 
}atres in Britain will be in the hands 
jof United States producers. 

One chain of theatres, Associated 
British Cinemas, are now present- 
ing the film here. It is showing in 
jthree theatres in London and play- 
|ing to full houses every day.

WEDNESDAY, 





FORD WILL EXHIBIT 
IN NATIONAL SHOW 


Company Breaks Precedent of 
40 Years to Join Herein | 
October Display | 


PATENT SUITSTARTED ROW 


Autos of All Makes Will Be 
Seen Under One Roof for 
First Time in History 


Breaking a precedent of some 
forty years, the Ford Motor Com 
pany it was disclosed yesterday, 
will participate in the annual Na 
tional Automobile Show, to be held 
under the auspices of the Auto- 
mobile Manufacturers Association 
in Grand Central Palace, Oct. 12 to 
20. From the time of the protracted 
litigation over the Selden patents, 
early in the century, the company 
has not been a member of the 
association or its forerunner In 
recent years it has held an exhibit 
of its own in New York, taking 
over the ballroom of the Hotel 
Astor, and, in addition, putting on 
a special showing at its building, 
1710 Broadway, during the period 
of the national show. 

‘‘We are glad to cooperate with 
the automobile industry,’’ Edsel 
Ford, president of the company, 
said in announcing acceptance of 
an invitation from the A. M. A. to 
participate in the forty-first na- 
tional show. ‘‘We will take part in 
the show at the Grand Central Pal- 
ace as a matter of convenience to 
the public in enabling it to see the 
products of the entire industry 
under one roof.’’ 


Applies for Space in Show 


To insure sufficient space for a 
group display of Ford, Mercury and 
the company 
has applied for a location on the 
floor of the Palace. In 
addition to the car display, applica- 
has been made for space to 


trucks and commercial products. 
The rift between the Ford com 
pany and the rest of the industry 
had its inception in a dispute as 
to requirements for license to man- 
ufacture automobiles under patents 
received in 1895 by George B. Sel- 


2, mM. Zea 
made in 1879 and constantly amend- 
ded to the time of issuance. In 1889 
Mr. Selden assigned to the Electric 
Vehicle Company, in which the 
H, Day, W. C. Whitney, Anthony 
F. Brady, Thomas F. 
A. B. Wagner, exclusive rights to 
his patent with power to grant sub- 
licenses. 

The company soon made plain its 
intention of enforcing the ‘‘basic”’ 
patent although early companies 
such as Duryea, Olds, Winton and 


others were producing automobiles. 





Licensed Group Is Formed 


On March 5, 1903, while litigation 
| was continuing, the Association of 
| Licensed Automobile Manufacturers 
| was formed by the Electric Vehicle 
Company and eighteen other manu- 
facturers, each of whom paid the 
| association a royalty of 1% per cent 
of the retail price of all vehicles it 
sold. Henry Ford and Thomas B. 
Jeffrey were among the pioneers 
who consistently refused to join the 
association or take out a license. 

In response to repeated warnings 
by the association ‘‘do not buy a 
|lawsuit with your automobile,’’ the 
| Ford company offered to give to 
each purchaser a bond protecting 
him against any damage that might 
arise from this quarter. The patent 
|was sustained by Judge Hough in 
the Circuit Court, but on Jan. 9, 
1911, the Circuit Court of Appeals 
sustained the patent, but held that 
the Ford company had not in 
fringed it. 

The License Association was suc- 
ceeded by the Automobile Board of 
Trade and then, in 1913, by the Na- 
tional Automobile Chamber of Com- 
merce, which in turn was succeeded 
by the Automobile Manufacturers 
Association The Ford Company 
has never participated in its show, 
but in recent years has joined with 
the association in a number of ac- 
tivities concerned with the welfare 
of the common business, notably a 
drive, in 1938, to reduce 


concerted 
of used cars in dealers’ 


the stock 
hands.

Mr. Brown said the signing of the

This must be followed by a hearing 
to fix property values and the let-

$1,000,000 SCHOOL 
WILL RISE IN BRONX 


New Elementary Institution 


Will Have Special Classes 
for Handicapped Pupils 


A new $1,000,000 elementary school 
for the Bronx, designed to provide 
community facilities within a small 
neighborhood building, is 
constructed by the Board of 
cation, Daniel P. Higgins, 
man of the board's buildings 
sites committee, announced yester- 
day. 

To seat 1,300 pupils, the new 
school, to be known as Public 
School 99, will be situated at Steb 
bins Avenue between Home Street 
and East 167th Street. It is ex 
pected to relieve overcrowding at 
Public Schools 20, 23, 63 and 124 
The construction will begin in June 
and is scheduled to be completed in 
September, 1941. 

Special facilities will be provided 
for the care and education of phys 
ically and mentally handicapped 
children. In addition to twenty regu 
lar units the school will 
have a special room for the instr 
tion of crippled children, two rooms 
for cardiac children, an open-air 
classroom and a room for pupils 
with retardad mental development 
Also provided will be two rooms for 
remedial instruction, a nature room, 
a geography room, kindergarten 
and kindergarten extension rooms 

Recreational facilities will include 
a gymnasium and a play room. There 
will be an auditorium seating 450 
students and a lunch room which 
may be used also as a community 
room 

“This will be a truly modern 
mentary school Mr. Higgins said 
“complete and compact. It will have 
all the features necessary for carry 
ing out the present-day educational 
program and will serve the needs 
both of, the children and the com- 
munity. Special facilities such as an 
auditorium and gymnasium and 
rooms for handicapped children will 
be provided upon the opening of the 
building and not postponed until the 
construction of another wing.’ 

To be constructed of red brick 
with limestone trim, the elementary 
school, according to the officials, 
will be one of the most attractive 
buildings of its kind in the educa- 
tional system.

Marshall Urges Musicians Fund to Omit

A plea that “highbrow” music be

Speaking before fifty members of 
the Musicians Emergency Fund at 
the home of' Mrs. Vincent Astor, 
130 East Eightieth Street, Mr. Mar- 
shall urged a musical program for 
children that is nearer their level 
of understanding. Most persons, he 
pointed out, rarely rise beyond the 
simplest folk music level 

Founded in 1932 to help needy 
artists, the fund gives intermittent 
help to 4,058 persons. A report of 
the fund’s status was given by Mrs 
Astor, acting president, and by 
Mme. Yolanda Mero-Irion, execu

Silver and Lace Combined 


Brocaded silver and fine lace 
were combined in the costume fash- 
ioned by Callot Mrs. Ogden 
Hammond, wife of the Ambassador, 
for a formal occasion at the Court 
of Spain. For a court presentation 
the Marquise Polignac the 
white satin gown embroidered with 
gold and ambé@r beads, by Worth, 
which takes its place in the galaxy. 
One of the most magnificent of the 
festive gowns is the one in which 
Mrs. Robert Kelso Cassatt was pre- 
sented at the last held in 
Germany in 1914. From the shoul 
ders of the slender silver brocade 
gown, Worth hung a sweeping train 
of pale blue in a matching pattern. 

The stately manikins, molded by 
Cora Scovil, change in type, coiffure 
and figure with each advancing 
style epoch. Waistlines tiny 
when the hourglass figure and bird- 
bustle prevailed, in the Six- 
ties and Seventies. Toward the end 
of the century attention was con- 
centrated on leg o’ muttons. Of this 
era there is an amazing example, 
the work of Altemus, a Philadel 
phia dressmaker, with bal!looning 
chiffon sleeves mounted on a gown 
of rustling striped taffeta.

PHILADELPHIA, April 30 CP! 


Two home runs each by Hal T'rosky 
and Ken Keltner sparked the In- 
dians to a 10-to-5 victory over Phil- 
adelphia today before a crowd of 
2,500. The victory gave Cleveland 
undisputed possession of first place 
in the American League race. 

The Indians peppered the offer- 
ings of two Athletic pitchers for 
thirteen blows. The early barrage 
which included Trosky’s first cir 
cuit clout with the bases empty, cut 
short Herman pitching 
debut before home town folk in the 
third with the count 4 to 1 against 
him Bill Beckman let two more 
runs in before he retired the side 

The husky Indian first sacker

The Harvard pair made a promis-

leading the attack brilliantly But 
after that the stalwart Flynn, who 
formerly represented Princeton Uni 
versity, began to play the high-class 
squash that made him a stand-out 
in singles all season 

With Dickson giving excellent 
support and at times eclipsing 
Flynn, the Bayside pair ran away 
with the second game, in which the 
losers lost the range of the telltale. 
Rice and Boyce rallied in the third 
and made a close fight, but could

Reg. U. 8. Pat. off 


By JOHN KIERAN 


Troubles of a Cabinet-Maker 


T was once set down that “some are born 
] great, some achieve greatness and some have 
greatness thrust upon them.” But what if those 
in the last class resist or ignore the thrust? 

The problem presents itself because some time 
ago this observer suggested some additions to 
the Cabinet in Washington and put the following 
“than-whomers” up for nomination 

For Secretary of Baseball—Roscoe Pound, 
Dean Emeritus of the Harvard Law School 

For Secretary of Golf *rofessor William Lyon 
Phelps of Yale and adjacent golf course 

For Secretary of Football—-Richard Cresson 
Harlow, Oologist, Harvard University 

For Secretary of Tennis—Professor Archibald 
Henderson, head of the Department of Mathe- 
matics, University of North Carolina 

To date, only one of those named has shown 
any sign of accepting the nomination, and even 
that one, Professor Henderson, is trying to make 
conditions. He thinks that tennis is too small a 
field for him and hankers for the chairs of Foot- 
ball and Baseball, too. 


Standing Firm 

This one-man nominating committee is stand- 
ing firm in the case of Dr. Henderson, biographer 
of Bernard Shaw, friend and mathematica! inter- 
preter of Dr. Albert Einstein, author of Contem- 
porary Immortals, At Home on the Ordinate, 
Life With an Abscissa and other works of fic- 
tion; he can take the tennis job or remain in ob- 
scurity. This isn’t France, where Cabinets are 
shuffled like a pinochle deck. 

Dr. Henderson was chosen for the tennis field 
because there are some tings that need explain- 
ing in that field. It is felt here that a man who 
can explain Ejinstein’s Theory of Relativity can 
explain anything, even the amateur rule in tennis 
and the way it is enforced or overlooked as the 
case may be. An ordinary citizen trying to follow 
the rulings of the tennis solons is soon stumped 
by what might be called quadratic evasions and 
differential calculations. 

Let Dr. Henderson invade that field with loga- 
rithmic tread and reduce the offenders to proper 
fractions, 

A Fair Choice 

In his grudging acceptance of the nomination, 
Dr. Henderson exposed, by letter, the logical re- 
action of a listener to one of his lectures at 
Town Hall here in New York City. It seems that 
there was an old gentleman apparently listening 
with fury to the Hendersonian explanation of 
Relativity. Dr. Henderson now serving: 

“This old gentleman, wearing thick-lens 
glasses that made his eyes look enormous, glared 
fixedly at me throughout the entire lecture with 
an expression it is an understatement to call 
murderous After the lecture, ,the chairman 
(President George Denny) said: ‘Before calling 
for questions I should like to suggest, since Dr. 
Henderson has carried us this morning far out 
into the interstellar spaces and given us a fas- 
cinating picture of the cosmos, that as many of 
you as can find time for it go from here to the 
New York Planetarium.’ 

“As if galvanized into action by a powerful 
electric current, my ancient listener started up 
from his seat and held aloft a trembling hand 


Yankees vs. St 


Sports Today 


BASEBALL 


for attention. On being recognized by Mr. Denny, 
he convulsed the audience with this delightful 
bon mot: ‘Pardon me for asking, but I happen to 
be a trifle deaf and I'm not sure I caught your 
last word. Did you say Planetarium or Sani- 
tarium?’” 

That just gives an idea of how overwhelming 
Dr. Henderson would be when he started lectur 
ing the offenders in his field as Secretary of 
Tennis. 


The Delinquents 


But if Dr. Henderson has indicated a willing- 
ness to come up to the public service line, there 
is grief in this corner over the deep silence of 
the other nominees. Not a signal from Oologist 
Harlow of Harvard University, proposed Secre- 
tary of Football. His excuse may be that he is 
too busy counting eggs before they are hatched, 
Not a word from Dean Pound, although the base- 
ball season is in full swing. Not even a three- 
page longhand letter from William Lyon Phelps, 
who probably is so intent on his own golf game 
that he can’t spare a minute to handle the affairs 
of other addicts 

Here is par taking a dreadful beating from 
fellows like Jimmy Demaret and Ben Hog 


Sam Snead, yet Professor Phelps is backward in 


an and 


coming forward either to revise standards or 
restore order on the links, There is the further 
feeling in this corner that Professor Phelps would 
be just the man to improve public speaking on 
private courses. Now a man who flubs a shot is 
usually left to his own resources in language, 
the result of which often is crude and inept ora- 
tory in no way fully expressing the weight of 
woe that sears the sufferer’s breast. At such 
moments, unable to put their anguish in proper 
words, misguided men have hurled clubs over 
fences, beaten their caddies and swooned in stut- 
tering fits 

To ease the tension on such occasions, Profes- 
sor Phelps is just the man to provide classic 
fodder for the tortured tongue. From Keats, for 
instance, upon missing a putt 

“Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 

To cease upon the midnight with no pain.” 

Or in the Shakespearean mood, on a topped 
tee shot: 

To be or not to be,” ete. 

Or in the Miltonian manner, on a ball out of 
bounds: 

“Ye gods! I'd rather be 

A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn, 

So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, 

Have glimpses that would make me lesa 

forlorn.” 


By the Pound 


As for Dean Pound, he knows baseball and he 
knows law and he would be a great one to atep 
in and handle the cases of big leaguers who ap- 
ply for Unemployment Relief in off-seasons. He 
could regulate these baseball schools that are 
now being run on the catch-as-catch-can plan 
and are beyond the reach of Judge Landis be- 
cause they are not part of organized baseball. 
The Harvard touch, which might be supplied by 
Dean Pound, would bring about a notable im- 
provement in conditions surrounding sand-lot 
baseball across#a the country.

MODEL PACT DRAWN) 
ON COSMETIC LINES 


Toilet Goods Group Drafts! 
Agreement for Use on 
Private Brands 


A form of agreement designed to 
eliminate misbranding or adultera- 
tion in the packaging of private 
brand cosmetics under Section 603 
he Federal Food, Drug and Cos- 
Act has been drawn up by the 
Toilet Goods Association, following 
numerous requests for such an 
agreement covering transactions be 
tween fr anufacturer and customer, 
it was learned here yesterday. 

The regulations issued by the Sec- 
retary of Agriculture under Section | 
provide that where cosmetics 
») be processed, labeled or re 
packed in an establishment owned 
by some one other than the original 
manufacturer, a written agreement 
signed by the actual man- 
ufacturer and the processor, labeler 
yr repacker. This must contain 

ions for such processing, 
or repacking, which will 
1 that the cosmetics will not 
be adulterated or misbranded upon 
the completion of the processing, 
labeling repacking. Each party 
must keep a copy of this agreement 
until all of the cosmetics in the 
shipment have been removed from 
establishments. 
of the agreement 
sets forth that the manufacturer 
agrees that any cosmetic now or 
hereafter furnished to the customer 
by name) will not be 
or unlawful within the 
Section 601 of the Fed- 
Drug and Cosmetic Act 
agreement states 
product will not be misbranded 
within the mean 

g of Section 602 of the act Sig 

atu of both manufacturer and 
customer are to be appended. 

Hugo Mock, counsel for the asso- 
pointed out that specifica- 
tions for the correct and legal label- 
ing of the products should be at- 
tached to the agreement so that 
the customer may be advised of the 
exact steps necessary to insure that 
the products are not misbranded 
the act when they enter the 

channels of trade. 

Copies of the agreement must be 
available to inspectors of the Food 
and Drug Administration upon re- 
he added.

Week-End Trade Rise Awaited 
Buying activity on Summer mer 
chandise continues to gain gradual 
ly in the wholesale markets here, 
but a sharp upswing is expected if 
warm weather spurs retail trade at 
the coming week-end. Some cities 
have already experienced a rise in 
temperatures and sales have gone 
ahead nicely. Bathing suits, beach 
wear and accessories are held likely 
to be reordered actively during the 
first warm spell.

Nashua Advances 
Advances ranging up to 2% per 
cent on its lines of cotton and part 
wool blankets were made yesterday 
by Nashua Manufacturing Com 
pany, and it was explained that 
prices were being put on a net 
basis. The discount system was dis 
carded because of the difficulty of 
adjusting actual prices on individ 
numbers to changes in the 
material picture. Nashua customers 
had been advised three weeks ago 
of the impending No. 2 list, and the 
response to that notice was de- 
scribed yesterd1y as satisfactory.

taining the stability of the local 
liquor market were given by repre 
sentatives distilling companies 
who met informally yesterday with 
the distillers’ committee of the Met 
ropolitan Council of Package Liquor

According to reports of the meet 
ing, distillers were told that, if price

SILVER REPEAL BILL 
PUSHED IN SENATE 


Way Is Cleared for Expected 
Passage of Ban on Buying 
of Foreign Metal 


COMMITTEE’S VOTE 14 T0 4 


No Provision Made Yet for 
Balloting on Companion 
Measure in House 


Special to Tos New Yorx Trves. 

WASHINGTON, April 30—The 
Senate today cleared the way for 
expected passage of legislation to 
repeal the law adopted in 1934 
under which the United States 
Treasury has bought foreign silver 
it prices fixed above the world 
market value of this metal 

The repeal bill, written by Sen 
ator Townsend and reported favor 
ably by the Banking and Currency 
Committee, which approved it by a 
vote of 14 to 4, was placed in posi 
tion for action shortly before the 
Senate recessed this afternoon, 

Prior to the recess the bill’s spon- 
sor outlined the basic arguments 
for the bill, among which he listed 
the fact that the government had 
bought ‘‘about two and one-third 
billion ounces, with absolutely no 
end yet in sight.”’ 

Senator Townsend denounced the 
program as ‘‘wasteful’’ and one 
which bestowed benefits on foreign 
countries with no consideration in 
return 

“After all the debate that has 
taken place in recent months,’ he 
said, “it would be perfectly clear 
that my bill, which does not touch 
silver at all, has as its 
termination of 
silver, a 
pointless 


domestic 
sole objective the 
the buying of foreign 
wasteful, unnecessary, 
and disturbing process The case

Leaders of both major parties in

be adopted with little objection,

AMSTERDAM, April 30—Despite 
favorable overnight New York ad-

profits announcements, the Bourse 
was reactionary today and the 
volume small, 

Among Dutch issues, Royal Dutch, 
tobaccos, tins and Amsterdam 
Trading were adversely affected, 
losing as much as 5 points. Rub- 
bers, shippings and industrials re- 
sisted well, generally losing not 
more than fractions. 

United States issues, after an 
easier opening, fluctuated mildly. 
At the close, there were signs of a 
moderate improvement and prices 
were irregular. There were no par- 
ticular features 

Bonds were quiet.

Sterling, after opening firm at 
6.65% guilders, receded to 6.62%. 
The dollar opened steady at 1.88% 
guilders, but closed at 1.88%. The 
belga was weak. Money rates were

There Still Is Room for Growth in Cities 
Despite the Competition of the Suburbs 


By LEE E. 


New Yor« 7 


Bpecial to Tue 

STAMFORD, Conn., April 30 
Here in the sunlit study on Hunting 
Ridge Road where Heywood Broun 
of his columns in his 
last years the typewriter is click- 
ing again after a brief, tragic inter- 
lude. 

The vast figure of a man who re- 
this black leather chair 
facile pen on al 
which to 

here, 
a few 


wrote most 


clined in 
wrote with 
subject 


and 

came 
but 

personal 


most 


mind 
books and 


any 


no longer his 
papers, 
things, and the countless telephone 
numbers he scribbled carelessly on 
the walls remain as the inspiration 
for 


ite 


literary output of a more lim 
i scope 

It is fitting enough, however, that 
the topic of real estate and its va 
the 


of some one in this coun 


ried emanations should occupy 
attention 
try place which the columnist loved 
s0 well 

He himself, perhaps unconscious 
ly, ventured into this field with his 
tender references to the 
countryside where he watched a 
modest, ramshackle old Connecticut 
home and the surrounding 
land gradually transformed 


frequent 


farm 
marsh 
into a splendid example of a mod 
ernized estate which, when finished, 
he appropriately called “Well 
Enough. 

A few days of 
ha as they would have in 
the 


living in this home 
ve shown, 
almost any other country place, 
merits of the arguments 
used by the city realty men in their 
conflict with suburban competition 
and their efforts to fight the decen- 
tralization trend. It is not neces- 
here to record these little trials, 
is hardly essential to point 


some of

“Just

so families in due tin 


go to the place they like best

In all other big cities in this coun 
try and elsewhere there is the prob 
of movement from the 


lem away 


crowded places Perhaps it is in 
anda

spired by a desire for peace 


retreat from today’s t1 orld

City realty men 


take 


this movement too much 


They would do well to 


accommo 


date themselves to the trend until 


it has halted or perhaps even re 


versed itself Many department 
merchandising

stores and other 


units have done so already fol

There is room growth in both

inherently antagonistic
